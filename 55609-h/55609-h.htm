</div><div class="indent0">Saying, “Here is a story-book
</div><div class="indent1">Thy father has written for thee.”
</div><div class="indent4">&mdash;Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Once on a time a little boy was taken from the noise
and bustle of city life to a sparsely settled land where a
great forest stretched away in every direction. To this land
his parents came to make a home in the heart of the deep
wood. A large log house had been built in an open space
from which great oaks, beeches, maples and other trees had
been removed, and here, surrounded by nature’s forms and
activities, they lived many years.</p>

<p>What a delightful experience this was to this little boy!
How wonderful this new world seemed to him! Here were
flowers of every hue, bees, birds, butterflies, and many
other interesting things to excite his childish wonder. He
soon learned the names of the shrubs, the trees, the wild
fruits and the flowers; and the habits of the honey gatherers,
the feathered folk, and the little animals of the wood.</p>

<p>This story has its foundation in these experiences and
was written in the hope that it will prove interesting and
instructive to many children. It teaches its young readers
to see material things as they really are, so that the early
impressions shall always be the true ones; it teaches them to
apply the same habit of careful observation to language forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and constructions, so they shall know how thoughts must be
expressed, and more than that, how they may be expressed
beautifully. It is believed that it will influence them to
observe nature’s works closely&mdash;the beauty in the dense
foliage of spring, in the myriad forms of life, in nest building
and bird music, in the vitality of growth, in the sweet
beneficence of the universal mother, so that they may come
to know</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Squirreltown? It is a
town of quaint homes in the woods, in which little
animals live together as contentedly as though they
were human beings. The whole town is roofed over
by leafy bowers, and carpeted with wild flowers.
All day long butterflies flit about in the shimmering
sunlight, and by night thousands of fairies come out
to dance in the pale moonlight.</p>

<p>In this town there once dwelt a young red squirrel
named Tiny. He lived with his mother near the
top of an oak tree. Mrs. Redsquirrel was a poor
but industrious widow. Although red squirrels are
said to be the most mischievous animals of the forest,
she had taught Tiny to conduct himself in a
proper way. In fact, he was much better behaved
than Chatty Chipmunk, who lived in the ground at
the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>One morning early in the autumn, while the
weather was yet warm, Tiny’s mother said to him,
“You must bestir yourself, Tiny! Now is the time
to gather acorns, seeds, and other food for the winter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>As he sat sipping water from a hollow acorn, he
observed how anxiously his mother gazed at him.
“Why do you look so sad?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am getting too old to work,” she answered,
and she wiped the tears from her black eyes. Then
abruptly she turned to look through the window.
It was a small hole covered with a silken curtain
that had been woven by a spider.</p>

<p>“Please don’t cry, mother,” implored Tiny. He
put down his acorn, went over to his mother and
drew her down upon a little couch made of moss.
“I am willing to work hard to support you. Perhaps
some day I shall become great. Who can
tell?”</p>

<p>“But I want you to have a fine education,” said
his mother, looking with pride at her son, “and we
have no good schools!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps a fairy may find me a good school. I
can work to pay my way!” cheerfully suggested
Tiny. “I have heard that those who do this make
the best students.” He fanned his mother with a
small peacock feather. He thought that she might
drop into a doze, for he knew that she had not been
sleeping much of late, but just then a persistent
rapping at the tree began.</p>

<p>“It must be Mr. Woodpecker,” said Mrs. Redsquirrel
with a sigh. “Every day he comes over
to rap this tree. The noise makes my head ache.”</p>

<p>“Please sit still. I’ll go outside to see what he
wants,” said Tiny, hastening from the room.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried lustily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Woodpecker did not answer. He was digging
his long, straight, pointed beak into the bark
of the tree. His stiff tail was spread out to prop
his body, for woodpeckers would not be such good
climbers if they had no tails. He was black and
white, and wore a jaunty scarlet cap.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Tiny, “You
annoy my mother. Furthermore,
Mr. Graysquirrel,
who owns this tree,
will make you pay dearly
for all the damage you are
doing to his property.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” laughed Mr.
Woodpecker, turning his
head to one side and looking
down at the squirrel.
“I am not destroying
property. I am digging
into the bark to find insects.
Mr. Graysquirrel,
your landlord, told me
that I might have all I
could find. He said it was
they who greatly annoy
his tenants. Pardon me
for disturbing your
mother.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“GO AWAY AND DO NOT COME BACK
AGAIN,” COMMANDED TINY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Go away! and do not come back again,” commanded
Tiny, vexed at the bird’s display of good
humor. “Hush, Tiny!” called Mrs. Redsquirrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
thrusting her dainty nose through the window. “I
am glad that Mr. Woodpecker is so kind as to destroy
those horrid insects. I thought at first that
he was tapping the tree because he wished to trouble
me. We animals are always ready to imagine disagreeable
things.”</p>

<p>Tiny came back into the house and to cover his
chagrin began to get the storeroom in order.</p>

<p>His mother gathered up the nut-shell cups and
placed them in a hollow gourd. As they worked
she talked. “Mr. Woodpecker is a clever creature,”
she said. “I never before saw a bird that
could use his bill with such ease and swiftness.”</p>

<p>Tiny did not reply. He was thinking very hard,
and the idea that he was going to support his
mother made him feel very important.</p>

<p>“Woodpeckers do a great deal of good by destroying
grubs and insects,” his mother went on.
“I have heard that in a far-away land there lives
one kind that feeds chiefly on acorns, and stores
them away for the winter as squirrels do. They
make small holes in the soft bark of dead trees
and place the acorns in these holes by pounding
them with their bills.”</p>

<p>“Now I am ready to start,” interrupted Tiny.
“Perhaps I can get Chatty Chipmunk to go with
me.”</p>

<p>“If you do, don’t let him lead you into bad
company!” warned Mrs. Redsquirrel. “He is very
mischievous. He causes his parents much trouble.”</p>

<p>At that moment Peggy and Bushy Graysquirrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
came running into the room, without stopping to
knock at the door.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mrs. Redsquirrel,” said Peggy.</p>

<p>“We are going over to the Beech Hotel to spend
the day with the Blacksquirrel family,” said
Bushy, too much excited to draw a long breath.
“Come along with us, Tiny. We will play ripple.”</p>

<p>“What is ripple?” asked Mrs. Redsquirrel.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a fine game!” exclaimed Peggy. “All
the squirrels get out on the bough of a tree. Each
one throws a nut or a pebble into the brook, and the
one that makes the biggest circle gets the prize.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go, Tiny?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“No, mother,” said Tiny bravely. “I like to
play ripple, but I must gather our winter store before
the cold rains begin.”</p>

<p>“Please come with us,” coaxed pretty Bushy,
flashing her dark eyes straight into his own.</p>

<p>“I cannot go,” he declared stolidly, turning his
back upon her.</p>

<p>“Is he really going to work?” asked Bushy,
looking from one to the other in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am going,” replied Tiny, and he took
down his hunting bag from the wall.</p>

<p>Another moment a little red squirrel ran down
the tree and was lost to view.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Tiny went to the home of Chatty Chipmunk.
The Chipmunks do not like the trees or the air or
the sunshine as the Redsquirrel family do. Like
most animals of their kind, they live in the ground.</p>

<p>Tiny entered the door and passed through a hall
several feet in length. At the further end of the
hall was a small opening which led to a room but
little larger than the shell of a cocoanut. Chatty
was alone, fast asleep.</p>

<div id="Ref_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" width="600" height="427" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“HOW CAN YOU SLEEP ON A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS?”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“How can you sleep on a beautiful day like
this!” cried Tiny, playfully pulling Chatty’s
whiskers.</p>

<p>“I was only taking a nap,” sleepily responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Chatty. “My parents and brothers are out in the
beech trees. I wanted to have a good rest, so I
stayed at home. I cannot sleep well at night, because
our house is crowded.”</p>

<p>“I am going out to gather our winter store,”
said Tiny. “Don’t you want to come with me?”</p>

<p>“I should very much like to go, thank you,” returned
Chatty, although he had refused to go with
his family. “But you see, I cannot work hard
when I work, though I can work hard when I
play.”</p>

<p>They soon left the chipmunk home and started
forth on their journey. They had not gone very
far before Chatty began to complain.</p>

<p>“The sun is very warm, and it makes me
drowsy,” said he. “How I do dislike to work!
I am glad that I am not a beaver, for beavers work
all the time.”</p>

<p>“I should think you would wish to help your
family,” said Tiny. “What will become of you in
the winter if you do not have plenty of food?”</p>

<p>“I will sleep all the time,” replied the chipmunk,
yawning drowsily.</p>

<p>He was about to lie down to rest, when he espied
a great yellow butterfly with wings that shone like
gold. She was fast asleep upon a thistle.</p>

<p>Chatty dashed after her, but she flew from
thistle to bush and flower, not at all frightened.
After he had tired himself running, he sat down,
panting.</p>

<p>“Your winter store will soon be gathered if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spend as much energy in working as you have in
running,” said Tiny, his eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>“It is great sport to chase butterflies,” said
Chatty. “They are such stupid creatures, yet they
are very pretty. Who ever heard of sleeping on a
thistle?”</p>

<p>“I think it would be much more comfortable
than to sleep in a hole in the ground,” replied
Tiny. “Mother said that butterflies always seem
to match the seasons.” Tiny, without knowing it,
began to imitate his mother’s voice and her way
of talking. He spoke more slowly than she did,
however, for he was trying hard to remember all
she had told him about the pretty things. “When
the world is still brown and bleak and the spring
sun is beginning to warm things into life, the
brown and black butterflies come. Then, when the
violets spread carpets over the vales and in the
woodlands, the blue butterflies appear. In summer
come the queenly swallow-tail butterflies, clad in
red, copper, and burnished silver. Often one
dressed in pure white may be seen, for white is very
comfortable to wear in warm weather. It reflects
the hot rays of the sun. In the autumn the yellow
and orange butterflies are more numerous. They
are the color of the goldenrod and the sunflowers
and the brown-eyed Susans. The yellow butterflies
like to sip the honey from the yellow flowers,
but the white butterflies seem to prefer the white
clover. They are the most beautiful of all insects.
Their four wings are colored on both sides. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
they rest, their wings stand straight up and do not
fold.”</p>

<p>“Butterflies are very queer animals,” said
Chatty ungraciously. He was vexed with butterflies,
because he knew so little about them. “Why
do they sleep with their wings held high above their
heads? I should think they would get so sound
asleep that they would forget to hold them up.”</p>

<p>“It is natural for them to hold up their wings,”
laughed Tiny. “Do you forget to breathe when
you are sound asleep?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” retorted Chatty, “nor do I forget
to eat when I am hungry. However, I cannot
see why the butterfly sleeps in such a silly position.”</p>

<p>“Some of them slowly open and shut their wings
all the time they are asleep,” explained Tiny. “I
never knew another creature that sleeps so gracefully
as the butterfly does. I would rather take a
nap on a thistle in the sunshine than roll up in a
fluffy ball and sleep in a dark hole in the ground.
You must not criticise those whose customs are
different from yours. Perhaps the butterfly is
quite as much amused at you.”</p>

<p>“There she goes again!” cried Chatty, suddenly.
“I wish I were a flying-squirrel, that I might catch
her. Wait a moment until I frighten her again.”</p>

<p>Chatty began to chase the butterfly once more.
He was accustomed to running without looking
where he was going, so he did not see the danger
that awaited him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SPLASH! CHATTY FELL INTO THE CREEK AND DISAPPEARED
FROM SIGHT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Splash! Chatty fell into the creek and disappeared
from sight. The butterfly flew safely across
the stream.</p>

<p>Tiny was not alarmed, for he knew that his companion
could swim. Soon the chipmunk’s little
nose appeared above the water. After a great
deal of splashing, he reached the bank of the
stream, very much chagrined.</p>

<p>“I think I must have been more scared than the
butterfly was,” he admitted, as he shook his fur.
“I am as tired as I can be and as wet as a fish.
Where is the butterfly?”</p>

<p>“Over on yonder blue-flag, fast asleep,” said
Tiny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Chatty smiled foolishly and Tiny laughed
heartily. The butterfly rested a long time. Then
she flew away. The birds chattered gayly as the
sun smiled brightly. The brook gurgled with glee
and flowed merrily on. The chipmunk seemed
wide awake after his drenching. For a half hour
he scurried briskly along.</p>

<p>“Not far away some fine blackberries grow on
low bushes,” he said. “We will find them and feast
until dusk. When we become sleepy we will nap
for a while.”</p>

<p>“We have wandered from our path,” protested
Tiny. “We are lost!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Chatty. “Someone will
show us the way home. Squirreltown is the greatest
city in the world.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember those hunters who passed
through Squirreltown not long ago?” asked Tiny.
“They said that London is the largest city in the
world. The East contains many great cities.”</p>

<p>“You are dreaming,” laughed the chipmunk.
“I have heard of every large city. Squirreltown
has the most inhabitants, and Gray Fox Center
comes next. How many squirrels live in London?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“London is filled with people, not with squirrels.
Those hunters that frightened us the other day are
people. They live in houses,” explained Tiny.</p>

<p>“How I should dislike London!” cried Chatty.
“Do all people look as fierce as those hunters? I
thought that hunters dwelt in holes in the ground.
I supposed that they played in the trees and wandered
about with huge guns and frightened little
animals for amusement. I imagine that people
must look very much like bears.”</p>

<p>“Many of them do,” assented Tiny with a wise
nod. “However, they do not walk on four legs, but
straight up like storks. We must roam no farther.
Let us gather these beech nuts and collect them
in little heaps.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said his companion, as he rose
from his couch. “I want some blackberries.”</p>

<p>“O Chatty, an odd-looking animal comes from
the trunk of that hollow tree. It is a bear!” cried
Tiny.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Chatty. His eyes opened wide
with fear and surprise. “We must hide.”</p>

<p>For a moment they gazed at the stranger who
stood before them. He sniffed the grass that grew
around a stump, but watched them steadily. The
little foragers remained quite still and struggled
for courage.</p>

<div id="Ref_19" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="600" height="532" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE LITTLE FORAGERS REMAINED QUITE STILL AND
STRUGGLED FOR COURAGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Be calm,” said the queer creature in a friendly
voice. “I am hunting for something green and
tender. Fear not, for I never attack such small
creatures as you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you, sir?” asked Tiny, remembering
his mother’s instructions to speak courteously.</p>

<p>“I am a raccoon and I live in that hollow tree,”
said the animal. “I once dwelt in a village which
lies a hundred miles away. Leachburg is its name.
The inhabitants called me Brother Raccoon. My
given name is Sambo, my wife’s name is Serena,
and we named our sons Simon and Solomon. Formerly
I was a pet in a family of people. While
with them I learned a number of pretty names for
children, as well as many other things.”</p>

<p>“Tell us something about people,” requested
Tiny, drawing nearer. At last he stood face to face
with the raccoon.</p>

<p>“People live a long time if they take good care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of their health,” began Brother Raccoon. “The
baby of this family was four years of age.”</p>

<p>Tiny and Chatty laughed outright. The speaker
smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“He was surely a backward baby,” chuckled
Chatty. “The mayor of Squirreltown is four years
of age and he is very old.”</p>

<p>“Little people are generally happy,” continued
the raccoon. “They have everything their hearts
desire. I wish that my little ones had such good
fortune. Alas! we watch Simon and Solomon all
the time. They seldom go out of the house except
after night. Little people stay indoors all night,
but little raccoons do not.”</p>

<p>“What lovely times little raccoons must have!”
cried Chatty. “If I were one of them I would run
about all night, especially when it is moonlight.
Mother sends me to bed before sunset.”</p>

<p>“No one has more anxiety than a raccoon,” declared
the stranger. He blinked his eyes, which
were black and shiny. There were white rings
around them. “Our midnight prowls often cause
us great trouble. Sometimes the raccoons go into
the cornfields. While they are eating corn, a pack
of dogs appears and drives them back to the woods.
Before the poor raccoons can hide, the men with
their guns attack them.”</p>

<p>“You should not steal the farmer’s corn,” reproved
Tiny. “Thieves deserve punishment.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the farmer does not treat us right,”
replied the raccoon bitterly. “He steals our fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and eats our flesh. He deceives us and slays us.
He does all sorts of mean things.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you,” said Tiny. “Why should
little animals of the forest suffer from the acts of
mankind? Are you never safe from harm?”</p>

<p>“No,” continued the raccoon. “Our flesh and
fur are so fine that these terrible people hunt for
us by day and by night. One evening I was in a
field of corn which was green and tempting. A
party of noisy creatures called boys came to the
field. They chased me back into the forest. I was
so little that I stumbled and fell. A dog caught me.
Before he could hurt me, a small boy seized me and
carried me in a bag to his home. He placed me in
a cage.</p>

<p>“The boy’s name was Teddy Root. He greatly
admired my dainty feet and grayish-brown fur. I
became so tame that they gave me much freedom.
I soon lost my fear of people. Sometimes they
scolded me, because I stole into the pantry and
helped myself to milk, sugar, lard, and butter. I
did not know that I had done wrong. Teddy took
cookies from the pantry without first asking his
mother’s permission, so I thought I could do so, too.
However, I yearned for my home in the deep forest.
One day I ran away.</p>

<p>“I wandered a long time before I found the
stump that had sheltered me during my early days.
My family had departed. I was alone, but I made
the old house comfortable, and soon forgot my
troubles. I preferred a stump to a gilded cage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
One night a party of raccoons went out on an excursion
to a cornfield. They took me with them.
It was then that I met my mate, Serena. Life is
happier now than it ever has been before.”</p>

<p>“We thank you for the story of your life,” said
Tiny. “Now show us the way to Squirreltown.”</p>

<p>“I have never heard of such a place,” replied
the raccoon, after he had thought hard for a few
moments.</p>

<p>“It is the largest city in the world and it is a
very important one, too,” snapped Chatty. He was
vexed at the stranger’s ignorance.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said the raccoon as he shook
his head doubtfully. “I know that Coontown is
much larger. You must ask some other animal to
show you the way.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Tiny. He never forgot the
value of politeness, although Chatty often did.
“We must hasten home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did you speak about those blackberries?”
he continued, as he turned to Chatty. “We
have lost our way. I fear dear mother grieves for
me.”</p>

<p>“It was no fault of mine that Mr. Raccoon
stopped us to tell the stupid story of his life,” retorted
Chatty. “See the acorns under the tree.
Some kind fairy knew that we were coming and
threw them down.”</p>

<p>Chatty ate greedily, while Tiny swiftly climbed
to the top of a huge oak tree and gazed all about
him. Nowhere could he see the friendly treetops
of Squirreltown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>Tiny sat for a long time in the top of the tree
and looked away as far as his eyes could see. In
the distance rose the big yellow moon. It shone
brightly upon the treetops of the great forest, yet
he could not see Squirreltown.</p>

<p>At last he began to descend slowly, almost frightening
to death a tree toad that was hopping about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on its little velvet toes among the green branches.</p>

<div id="Ref_23" class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;">
<img src="images/i_023.jpg" width="564" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TINY’S BUSHY TAIL STIFFENED WITH FRIGHT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tiny’s bushy tail stiffened with fright when he
heard a loud, whirring sound and a shrill cry from
the branch over his head. Two big yellow eyes
glared at him through the dense foliage. They
scared him so that he could not scamper away.</p>

<p>“Hoot! hoot!” cried the dreadful creature.
“Why are you prowling around my castle at this
time of night? Don’t you know that I am a horned
owl? I like to eat rabbits, squirrels, and mice.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean to disturb you, sir,” said Tiny
politely, although his teeth chattered and his limbs
refused to move. “My name is Tiny Redsquirrel.
I have lost my way. Can you tell me where to find
Squirreltown?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew where it is,” said the owl, “for
it wouldn’t take me long to put an end to it. Come
closer that we may have a little chat. I like squirrels.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Owl, I know that it would not be prudent
for me to get closer to you,” said Tiny, without
moving a step. “I want everyone to like me, but
I do not want them to like me well enough to eat
me.”</p>

<p>“Well spoken!” cried the owl, clapping his wings
and screeching loudly. “A fairy told me, Tiny,
that you were coming to my castle. I promised her
that I would not hurt you. Tell me what gift you
desire above all things else.”</p>

<p>“A good education,” replied Tiny promptly.</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed the owl. “Of course, squirrels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cannot expect to know very much. Red squirrels
are too mischievous to learn a great deal. They
worry robins in their nests, frighten field mice,
steal from the farmer’s granary, and spring the
traps that hunters set for martens. Can you tell
me who is the wisest of all living creatures?”</p>

<p>“I think it must be the donkey,” said Tiny after
hesitating a few moments.</p>

<p>“The donkey is as stupid as a stump,” said the
owl impatiently. “What makes you think that the
donkey is the wisest of all creatures?”</p>

<p>“An animal that makes so much noise must be
very wise,” answered the innocent squirrel.</p>

<p>“When you are older, you will learn that the
wisest creatures seldom make any noise at all,” said
the owl with a sage toss of his head. “The donkey
is most unlike the animal that represents wisdom,
and he&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the wisest animal is the loon,” interrupted
the squirrel.</p>

<p>Tiny had never heard the expression “crazy as
a loon,” or he would not have made such an absurd
guess.</p>

<p>The owl laughed again. “Poor little squirrel,”
he continued, “you are much in need of an education,
and I will help you to realize your wish. An
old loon lives two hundred yards from here in
some dry muck on the ruins of an old muskrat
house. Whenever she tries to avoid danger, she
always runs the wrong way and jumps into it. Her
legs are placed so far back beneath her body that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
she cannot walk very long at a time without toppling
over. When she swims, she makes more noise
than a family of beavers. She screeches all the
time, and consequently gets no opportunity to
think. You know that to be wise one must be a
quiet thinker. No, the loon is as dull as the
donkey.”</p>

<p>“Then who is the wisest of all creatures?” asked
Tiny, growing more and more interested.</p>

<p>“Have you never heard that the owl is the symbol
of wisdom?” asked the curious creature.
“There is nothing I do not know.”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps you can tell me where Squirreltown
is situated,” said Tiny, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” replied the owl, glaring at
Tiny until he again lost courage. “I do not fill my
mind with useless knowledge, since there are so
many important things to know. How ridiculous
of you to ask me such a question! You might just
as well ask why the moon, although not so large as
a pumpkin, can light up this great world of ours.
There are many things that learned students cannot
explain so ordinary creatures can understand. I
believe, however, that if you live long enough and
keep traveling all the time, you may find Squirreltown
one of these days.”</p>

<p>“This is no time for jesting,” burst forth Tiny,
his heart sinking. “I greatly desire to get home.
I started out to gather our winter store in this
hunting-bag, but I got lost. Mother must be quite
tired looking for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your mother need not wear her eyes out <em>looking</em>
for you, since you are surely old enough to <em>see</em>
for yourself,” retorted the owl.</p>

<p>Tiny said that he must hasten on.</p>

<p>“Do not be in a hurry, my restless quadruped,”
said the owl. “Squirrels are always in a hurry.
You are very nervous animals. It makes me dizzy
to look at you. I am the wisest creature of the
forest, yet you do not choose to tarry long enough
to get some useful information. Do you still desire
an education, or have you changed your mind?”</p>

<p>“I want to get home,” sobbed Tiny.</p>

<p>“I will see that your wish is granted,” said the
owl, more kindly. “What else do you wish?”</p>

<p>“I wish to grow up to be a useful squirrel.
I want to make my mother and everybody else
happy.”</p>

<p>The owl asked him what more he desired.</p>

<p>“That is all,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Then do as I say,” commanded the owl.
“Before you can become truly wise, you must learn
the lessons of patience and industry, and, as you
struggle, you must sing the song of contentment.
I am a wise prophet, and I will see that your wishes
are fulfilled.</p>

<p>“To-night you must sleep out in one of those
hazel bushes. Be sure to hide yourself, for sometimes
I fly about while asleep. In that case
perhaps I might eat you without knowing it.
To-morrow at dawn, follow the path that leads to
the brook. Then turn to your right. If you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
turn to your left, you would soon find yourself in
Big Bear City. Keep your eyes wide open, and
when you least expect it, you will be taught the
lesson of patience.</p>

<p>“Follow the footpath till you come to a lovely
dell, where a fairy princess will teach you the
lesson of industry and the value of doing good to
others. She probably can show you the way to
Squirreltown, for she knows all about geography.
But, ere you reach home, you will have two dreadful
encounters. A four-legged giant with hundreds
of darts will rush upon you when you least expect
it. Do not be frightened. Be calm and cautious.
Lie close to the ground so that his darts will pass
above you, should he throw them at you. Seize one
of his darts, jab him; he will then run away.</p>

<p>“Soon you will find yourself in the heart of a
jungle that almost all tame beasts fear to enter.
Another giant, a big black one, will try to hurt
you. However, you will be protected. Do as I
command, or you will never get back home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Owl,” said Tiny, willing to
endure any hardship if he could only see his mother
again. “Should you come to Squirreltown, the
Mayor will tell you where to find me. He is
stopping at the Beech Tree Inn.”</p>

<p>“What kind of stops does he use?” asked the
owl, much amused.</p>

<p>Tiny stared at him in wonderment.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean that he is <em>staying</em> at the
Beech Tree Inn,” said the owl. “I hope you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
enjoyed your visit in my castle. If you will stay
a while longer I will sing. I have a most beautiful
voice. I can sing twice as loud as a village of
sparrows.”</p>

<p>The little red squirrel did not insist upon hearing
the owl prophet sing, for that would have been bad
manners.</p>

<p>With a polite goodnight, he scurried down the
tree to a clump of hazel bushes, where he hid himself
as securely as possible. He slept very little,
for he feared that the wise owl might fly about in
his sleep and possibly devour him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>The sunbeams shine through the boughs of the
trees and the winds rustle gently. The dewdrops
glitter on the grass. The brook bounds joyously
along. The birds sing gaily and the little animals
of the wood come forth to listen to the sweet music.
The wild flowers open their pretty cups.</p>

<p>Now the forest is ringing with glad shouts and
songs. The sunbeams are growing brighter. The
winds are dying down and the dewdrops are
passing away. The brook is bounding along more
joyously. The birds are singing more gaily. The
little animals are running hither and thither. The
flowers are spreading their pretty cups wide open
to catch the sunlight. At last Tiny is waking.</p>

<p>When Tiny awoke from his slumbers in the hazel
brush, he scampered down to the edge of the brook,
washed his face, and combed out his long, bushy
tail. Then he began to call for Chatty, but no
answer came. He finally decided to start alone.
He remembered to take the path leading to the
right as the owl had directed him. For a long time
he sauntered along, admiring the elder, oak, and
buckeye trees, and occasionally he darted his
piercing gaze at some low-hanging black haw or
pawpaw bush, fearing some animal might attack
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>At last he came to a sandy plain, where he sat
down to rest in the sunshine. Not far away he saw
a city. Its streets were filled with busy inhabitants.
Hundreds of them were hurrying to and
fro, working with all their energy. Many little
workers were erecting buildings. To lift a single
grain of sand each was toiling with all his might.
They did not stop to rest or to visit, but kept
working, working, working. Tiny thought it would
take them a long time to build houses from grains
of sand.</p>

<div id="Ref_31" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THEY DID NOT STOP TO REST OR VISIT, BUT KEPT WORKING,
WORKING, WORKING.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While the architects were busy building new
homes, some soldiers in shiny, red clothes moved
about as if they were giving orders to the workers.
A crowd of watchmen stood at the gates of the city,
ready to give warning at the approach of an enemy.</p>

<p>Not one of the little creatures was alarmed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the squirrel. They heeded him no more than Tiny
did the tree beneath which he was crouching. He
drew nearer and saw that there were many little
rooms near the surface of the city and that below
them was a great public dining-room and storeroom.
Evidently they all ate their meals together.
These rooms were kept in order by a host of
servants, who were very busy all the time carrying
out shells, seeds, and the remains of insects. Others
collected all the rubbish and carried it out into a
heap outside the city limits. Scores of nurses were
looking after the babies, and teaching them that the
time would soon come when they must labor like
their elders.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great commotion in the
street. Some food providers were struggling along
with a fly they had found. They were taking it to
the storeroom. The load was so heavy that several
household workers rushed out to lend their help.
They toiled along together, slowly, with one united
effort, and with great difficulty; but, finally, they
stowed the fly headlong into the public storeroom.
Tiny breathed a sigh of relief when their hard task
was done.</p>

<p>But they did not stop to rest. They turned out
to help others bring in a locust. The workers in
the storeroom cleared a place for other provisions;
the watchmen guarded the gates, without taking
their eyes from their work; the architects, steadily
and patiently, carried grain after grain of sand to
the tops of their buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“How full of energy they are!” exclaimed
Tiny. “By their combined efforts they can build
and support a great city. If something destroys it,
they build it up again. I wish squirrels would
work together as these insects do. Oh, I see! It
is as the owl prophet said. I have learned the
lesson of patience. I do feel glad that I was permitted
to study this wonderful city. However, I
am surprised to learn such a noble lesson from the
smallest of all creatures&mdash;ants!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Not far from the city of ants, Tiny halted to
refresh himself with an acorn.</p>

<p>“This country is delightful,” he said to himself.
“A squirrel does not often
see such a beautiful scene.
He has little knowledge of
the great world. I was discontented
not long ago, but
now I am happy. I am
glad that I saw the ants
and their city. They are
very industrious creatures.
All have much work to do,
yet they do it willingly.
They don’t seem to wish to
be idle. Ants never before
were interesting to me, but
now I admire them very
much. You have taught
me a lesson, friend ant.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SUDDENLY HE SAW A SPIDER BUSY
AT WORK UPON HER COUNTRY
HOME.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He sat still for a few moments gazing around
him. Suddenly he saw a spider busy at work upon
her country home. She wore a snuff-brown jacket
dashed with purple, and her legs were striped like
those of a tiger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>She had just finished digging a tunnel seven
inches long in the earth, and had lined it with a substance
that looked like silk. Now she was spinning
a web to cover the outer door, which was really a
dry oak leaf. She left an opening large enough
to pass through. Then she pulled some blades of
grass and fastened them across the leaf so securely
that the entrance to her home could not be seen.
She worked very busily, although occasionally a
rude wasp came along and tried to sting her. In
spite of disturbing insects, the spider finished
building her home. Then she twined some tiny
vines about the entrance, making a green bower
that looked very pretty. When her difficult task
was completed, she crawled into her silk-lined hall
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“Plucky wood spider!” cried Tiny in admiration.
“Although the wasps threaten her life, she
never gives up. You work diligently, little friend.
I admire you very much. I have learned a lesson
in perseverance.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE SAW A DARK OBJECT SITTING
DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tiny did not hunt a place in which to sleep until
it was quite late. Indeed, the moon was beginning
to shine before he thought of rest. Just as he was
about to leave the path turning to the right, he saw
a dark object sitting directly in front of him. It
was singing in a clear and plaintive voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote4">“Wur-r-r, wur-r-r, wur-r-r,
</div><div class="indent0">I never complain nor demur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
</div><div class="indent0">Though the fox and the bat and the weasel and cat

</div></div></div>

<p>“How fortunate it is
that an ugly creature may
have the power to sing!”
exclaimed Tiny so loudly
that the toad who had been
singing grew frightened
and leaped into the tall
grass.</p>

<p>“You have taught me
the song of contentment,
Mrs. Toad,” he continued.
“I have many privileges
that you do not enjoy, for
you only venture forth at
night. Although hundreds
of animals are waiting to
destroy you, your song never loses its vigor. Your
only recreation is to catch a few insects and to
sit in the moonlight, singing ‘Wur-r-r, wur-r-r,
wur-r-r’.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Tiny spent the night in the fork of a wild plum
tree. For some time he sat thinking of his mother
and Squirreltown, but his lessons in patience and
contentment had made him satisfied with his lot.</p>

<p>The next morning he started upon his journey,
bravely following the narrow, twisting path, ever
ready to avoid danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<div id="Ref_37" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE A DRINK WHEN HE SAW WHAT HE
TOOK TO BE A FAIRY STRUGGLING IN THE WATER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At length he came to a brook. He was about to
take a drink when he saw what he took to be a
fairy struggling in the water. She had been trying
to get out for a long time; but, finally, her wings
ceased to move and she lay very still.</p>

<p>Tiny, who was a good swimmer, hurried out to
rescue her. He placed his nose under her and
lifted her from the water. Holding his head high,
he swam to the shore.</p>

<p>The fairy crawled upon a lady’s-slipper close by
and flapped her wings until they were quite dry.</p>

<p>“You have done me a great service,” she said.
“I’ll repay you some time when you least expect
it. I can’t tell you how grateful I am.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try,” said Tiny, with a polite bow. “I’ve
been taught to protect the helpless, provided they
are not too big for my protection. I hope you are
quite dry now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall be able to fly back to the city as
soon as I get my breath,” she said. “I am a queen
bee and I should not be out of my hive. I left
the palace this morning with several thousand followers
and was on my way to a far-off country,
when, in some peculiar manner, I fell into the
water. I could not swim, so it is lucky for me that
you came by.”</p>

<p>“I hope that your followers will find you. They
must be greatly distressed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope they’ll find me,” said the queen bee,
as she flapped her wings. “You see, I have thousands
and thousands of children; but they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
good nurses and are never much bother. It is not
hard to govern them.”</p>

<p>Tiny gazed at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“I have been queen of a place called the City
Wonderful,” she continued. “I ruled fifty thousand
subjects. We lived in a great city with
narrow streets, protected by a beehive. You don’t
know what a very busy place it was all summer
long.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t seem possible that so many
creatures could live together. Just imagine
fifty thousand red squirrels in one tree!” gasped
Tiny.</p>

<p>“That’s different,” responded the queen. “We
live together in co-operation. Each of the workers
knows her work and does it without having to be
watched all the time. The workers are females,
and they are very industrious; but the drones are
males, and they do not work. They have to be
driven out of the city before winter sets in, or they
would eat all our provisions. The workers toil
from morning till night, stopping up cracks in the
hive with wax, carrying food to the baby bees, and
storing it away for winter. They haven’t time to
play in the summer. Each worker has six little
pockets which she fills with pollen. She uses this
in making wax for the walls. As soon as the walls
are built, another set of workers make round
places, or cells, in them. Others fill the cells with
honey from the honey bags they carry about when
they visit the flowers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“But where do the little baby bees stay?” asked
Tiny.</p>

<p>“Oh, they stay in the empty honey cells and are
watched and cared for by their nurses until they
are old enough to work,” replied the queen.
“There is much to do, but there are many classes
of workers, from the honey gatherers to the bees
that stand inside the hive, fanning with their wings
to make currents of air; for without pure air the
crowded City Wonderful would not be a fit place
to live in. Another set of bees cleans out the cells
after the baby bees are old enough to come out,
and others guard the gate of the city to keep away
moths and other troublesome creatures.”</p>

<p>“Bees are wise, sensible, industrious, and useful,”
declared the squirrel. “I should like to see
the City Wonderful. I am very glad that I have
the privilege of seeing a queen bee. I wasn’t
expecting such a great pleasure.”</p>

<p>The queen bee said that she was equally glad to
see the red squirrel, and that she would be delighted
to invite him to see the new City Wonderful, were
it not for the fact that her soldiers might make
it unpleasant for him.</p>

<p>“Are there many kinds of bees?” asked Tiny
presently.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are fully seventy known varieties,”
replied the queen, daintily flapping her wings.
“There are the plasterer bees. They make tunnels
in the ground, divide them into cells, and fill them
with honey. They have forked tongues to use as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
trowels in smoothing down the silken layers which
they use in making the tunnels. The flower riflers,
which are very dark in color, make their cells on
dry walls. Their homes look like lumps of mud.”</p>

<p>Tiny asked if all the bees live in great cities.</p>

<p>“Not all of them,” replied the queen, “although
they are very sociable creatures. The upholsterer
bee cuts out round pieces from rose leaves, with
which she lines her tiny nest. Would it not be
delightful to live in a nest of sweet-smelling rose
leaves? I should much prefer such sweet quietude
to city life. The upholsterer stores honey and pollen
that looks like rose-colored jam. I dare say it is
very delicious. The mason bees take bits of chalk,
sand, and woody material, which they make into
tiny bricks to use in building their little houses.
Another kind of bee hunts for an old snail shell in
which to make her house. There is another variety
that builds its nest in the heart of the scarlet poppy.
Some bees throw out sweet perfume. Although
most bees work in the sunshine, there is a class,
with wings tinted like the rainbow, that works by
moonlight. You may be learned, my friend, but I
could sit here all day and tell you things about
bees. You would be much surprised at many facts
I should mention. Bees, wasps, spiders, and ants
are very clever.”</p>

<p>Tiny said that there was nothing that could give
him greater pleasure than to hear her talk.</p>

<p>“But my body guard is coming,” continued the
queen. “It is really an extraordinary thing for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
queen bee to be without attendants. They must be
much distressed about losing me.”</p>

<p>Tiny asked why she had left the City Wonderful.</p>

<p>“Because of family troubles,” replied the queen,
somewhat ashamed. “We lived in perfect harmony
until I learned that my daughter, the
princess, would come out of her nursery cell in a few
days to enter society. Princess bees are the only
ones that cause trouble. They are fed on the finest
food, and the nurses work hard to make their bodies
as smooth and comely as possible. Of course,
daughters that live in luxury and never have any
responsibility are likely to be spoiled. Like all
queen bees I am in fear of the eldest princess.”</p>

<p>“Why?” cried Tiny in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t understand bees,” said the queen
with a sigh. “When my eldest princess comes
from her nursery and is ready to go into society,
she will try to kill me. She will strive to be queen.
It is always that way with the princesses.”</p>

<p>“What a cruel daughter!” exclaimed the squirrel,
much horrified.</p>

<p>“All princesses try to get the queens out of the
way,” said the bee in a sad voice. “As soon as
they are big enough to rule others, they want to
control everything. So I have gotten several thousand
loyal subjects and have left the hive to build
a city of my own.”</p>

<p>“And will a cruel princess become queen in
your place?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the response, “but before long she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
will become uneasy, too. Her next younger sister
will come out of her nursery and will want to rule.
Perhaps there will be a great contest, but doubtless
the elder princess will have to flee as I have done.
She will have fewer followers than I, and they will
be called the after-swarm. Thus jealousy goes on
in the royal family all the time, but the other bees
are usually peaceable and are always busy.”</p>

<p>At that moment Tiny heard a buzz that sounded
as though all the insects in the world were singing
together. A great swarm of bees, like a black
cloud, appeared overhead.</p>

<p>“I believe this must have been the first time in
history that a queen ever got away from the rest
of the swarm,” said the queen bee. “I have enjoyed
this little visit so much, and I thank you a
thousand times for saving me from drowning.”</p>

<p>Waving her pretty wings in graceful farewell,
she joined her army of soldiers, and with buzzes
of delight they carried her away.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful thing it is to be a ruler, in
constant fear of death!” said Tiny, gratefully. “I
am glad&mdash;oh, so glad&mdash;that I am a little common
squirrel, as free as the sunbeams that light my
way.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>After his strange meeting with the queen bee,
Tiny wondered what would happen next. He
remembered what the owl prophet had said concerning
the dangers he would meet. As he sped
onward, his little heart began to beat less bravely,
for, like any young squirrel that had lived in a
comfortable home without a care or a worry, he
dreaded to face an uncertain future.</p>

<p>“I am frightened,” he said, with a shudder, as
he stopped at the edge of a clump of cedars to find
a place in which to spend the night. “The day and
the twilight are gone. No moon or star is in the
sky. I wish I were at home with mother.”</p>

<p>Then came a crash. Tiny thought for a moment
that it was hailing. He was about to hide in the
grass when a bright green light flashed forth, so
brilliant that he could see all about him. He soon
learned that the crash was caused by a multitude of
acorns that the wind had shaken from a tree.
Never before had he seen such splendid acorns.</p>

<p>“I will fill my hunting-bag, although such a large
load will cause me to travel more slowly,” he said.
“A bagful of acorns is a nice thing to have. How
happy mother will be to get them!”</p>

<p>He began helping himself to the acorns. Suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he saw an ogre emerge from the ground, with
a thousand darts all pointed straight at him. Never
before in all his life had Tiny been so frightened.</p>

<p>“Hist!” cried the ogre, advancing slowly towards
the poor, trembling squirrel, his sharp teeth
showing in a ghastly manner. “One of the squirrels
of the forest enters my realm. What shall I
do with him?”</p>

<p>A hundred voices cried out in reply:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Master Ogre, friend so true,

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Poor Tiny could only stand and shiver, awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his dreadful fate. The green light became brighter
and brighter, and soon he saw that he was surrounded
by a circle of glow worms. The ogre was
a fierce porcupine. Tiny had never before seen
such a terrible creature.</p>

<p>“Every soldier in my army is loyal to me!”
shouted the porcupine boisterously. “Each comes
with a lantern to help me. They will aid me to
tie you, place you in that bag, and hang you in my
den deep down in the cold ground.”</p>

<p>“I did not come to rob you,” mumbled Tiny,
shaking violently. “I am lost, and am trying to
find my way home. This is my hunting bag in
which I gather my winter store. Please let me
go unharmed.”</p>

<p>“Neither you nor your hunting bag has any
right to be on my castle grounds,” growled the
porcupine. “Either the woodchuck or the rabbit
has told you that I have many priceless valuables
hidden in my storeroom.”</p>

<p>“I have never met the woodchuck, nor have I
seen the rabbit for many weeks,” wailed Tiny. “In
my hunting bag are acorns and beech-nuts. I
halted underneath this tree to gather a few of these
fine acorns.”</p>

<p>“Guilty creature!” cried the porcupine, bristling
still more. “Do not these acorns belong to me, also
the tree they grow upon? Confess now that you
were going to burrow into my storeroom and carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
off the precious carrots and cabbage leaves I have
stored away for a rainy day.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said Tiny, almost dead
from fright, while the glow worms circled still more
closely about him.</p>

<p>Just then he remembered what the owl prophet
had told him to do. As the porcupine attempted
to seize him, Tiny leaped forward and caught one
of the sharp darts and gave him a hard jab, which
made the porcupine shriek at the top of his voice.
Moaning with pain,
the ferocious creature
disappeared
into the ground.
The glow worms
vanished.</p>

cried Tiny in delight,
whirling the
dart about in the
air. “I am glad

<p>Still carrying the

<p>Soon the rays of the moon made everything as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>

the owl prophet had spoken.</p>

<p>“It is a dismal place after night,” he said, “but
I must go into the jungle as I have promised to do.

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Deeper and deeper Tiny wandered into the heart
of the jungle. It was very damp and chilly as well
as ghostly. His hunting bag was heavy, but he did
not lose heart.</p>

<p>He had heard that fairy princesses with torches
often came to the aid of good squirrels that were in
trouble. He wished that they would come to help
him. But the dark trees and bushes looked like
frightful hiding places for foxes and other mischievous
animals. He grew more and more
alarmed. Finally he halted at the foot of a pine
tree.</p>

<p>“I will spend the night here,” he said to himself.
“I shall be out of danger in this great tree. What
a lonesome place it is! This is one of the gloomiest
valleys I ever saw. I’ll hide my acorns under the
tree and find a place in which to rest.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken these words, when a
terrible growl fell upon his ears. At the same time
a great black object rose between himself and the
tree. It was the largest creature Tiny had ever
seen.</p>

<p>“It is the black giant that Mr. Owl told me
about,” chattered Tiny, dropping his hunting bag.
“Oh, what shall I do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The giant, which was really a black bear, growled
louder than before and tried to strike Tiny with
his great paw. The red squirrel, quick as a flash,
attacked the giant with his dart, but only broke it
into several pieces. Then, as fast as his legs could
carry him, he scurried up the pine tree. The bear,
shaking with rage, attempted to climb the tree, too,
but he was so heavy that a bough gave way, and he
fell clumsily to the ground.</p>

<div id="Ref_51" class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/i_051.jpg" width="452" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE WAS SO HEAVY THAT A BRANCH GAVE WAY
AND HE FELL CLUMSILY TO THE GROUND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“You may be a great fighter on the ground, but
you can’t climb trees,” laughed Tiny in spite of his
recent fright.</p>

<p>“You shall stay in that tree till your beard turns
gray,” growled the bear, “for I intend to see that
you do not escape.”</p>

<p>Tiny hid himself in one of the thick branches and
remained quiet for a long time. He feared to go to
sleep, lest he might fall upon Mr. Bruin’s upturned
nose. In the meantime, the bear fell into a deep
slumber.</p>

<p>Finally the thought struck Tiny that he might be
close to Squirreltown. He quickly ascended to the
topmost branch and looked all about him.</p>

<p>Less than two miles away he saw a wonderful
sight. It seemed to him that millions of bright
stars clustered together over the top of a tall tree
in the east. They circled briskly about, sparkling
and flashing like diamonds in an immense crown.</p>

<p>“The good owl prophet has told me the truth
from first to last,” said Tiny, his heart almost
bursting from joy. “I recognize the dear old oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
where I was born, although it is a long distance
away. Squirreltown stands under that crown of
heavenly bodies. Never before have I seen that
kind of stars. Those rays are as bright as these
anxious eyes of mine. Hurrah for home and
mother! How strange it is that all my difficulties
have helped me to find the right way home!”</p>

<p>He hastened down to the lowest branch of the
tree, but Bruin was still sleeping, with his head
against its massive trunk. Tiny, whose mother had
taught him the lesson of prudence, did not dare to
venture down, lest the big black bear should seize
him. So he went back to his resting place, and soon
fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the early gray dawn, he awoke and peeped
from his cozy shelter. The birds were leaving their
green roofs to find food for their families. The
daisies in the woods and valleys were beginning to
spread their white and crimson-tipped stars. The
leaves trembled in the early breezes. Old Bruin
was not far from the tree. He had found a hollow
stump, and was rooting around it with his long
nose.</p>

<p>Soon there was a buzzing sound that swelled into
an angry roar. Old Bruin, in trying to steal some
honey, had gotten into trouble with the bees. The
swarm was very angry. Hundreds of bees poured
from the stump and alighted on his head, in his
eyes, ears, and nostrils.</p>

<div id="Ref_54" class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="300" height="492" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">CRAZED WITH PAIN THE BEAR DASHED
AWAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Crazed with pain, the bear dashed away, bellowing
at the top of his voice. Tiny, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
very kind-hearted and forgiving, could not keep
from laughing at the plight of the bear. His cries
sounded like the mingled shrieks of many different
animals, for the sting of each bee was like the
cut of a knife.</p>

<p>Tiny scurried down
the tree to find his hunting
bag, and what was
his delight to find other
delicacies that would
make his winter store
complete.</p>

<p>“What a glorious
jungle this is!” he cried.
“I am glad I followed
the advice of the owl
prophet, for no squirrel
has ever before been so
fortunate. The ground
is covered with pine
cones, the seeds of which
are delicious. Across the
way is a large quantity
of beech-nuts, and all
around me are blackberry bushes. There is nothing
else so delicious as dried blackberries.”</p>

<p>In the midst of his joy, the queen bee that he had
rescued from the brook lit upon a purple crow-foot
growing by the stump, and cried out:</p>

<p>“Good morning, my four-legged friend. You
are the squirrel that saved my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am glad to see you again, your majesty,” said
Tiny with his polite bow. “I wish you had happened
to come sooner, for that dreadful black giant
made me stay in yonder pine tree all night long.”</p>

<p>“The impudent creature tried to get into our new
home in the stump,” said the queen. “My soldiers
will chase him and his companions so far away that
they will never find their way back here.”</p>

<p>“You have done me a great service,” said Tiny,
with a second bow. “I thank you from the bottom
of my heart.”</p>

<p>“A kind act always brings its reward,” said the
queen cheerfully.</p>

<p>“But how can a tiny bee scare such a monstrous
creature as a bear?” asked the squirrel.</p>

<p>“One bee couldn’t scare anything,” laughed the
queen. “You must remember that bees work together.
When hundreds and hundreds of bees
attack a bear, he is sure to make good use of his
legs.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather unpleasant to live in a stump,
after having been queen of the City Wonderful?”
asked Tiny, after a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“No, I rather enjoy the change,” returned the
queen bee, with a merry buzz. “I hear that my
oldest daughter, the princess, is now queen of the
City Wonderful, but that she is uneasy all the time,
as her next younger sister is almost ready to leave
her nursery and fight for the crown. Occasionally
there is strife in the City Wonderful, for as soon as
a princess leaves her nursery, she wants to rule. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
am quite content to live here with my twenty thousand
faithful followers. It is better to live peaceably
in a stump than with a quarrelsome daughter
in a fine palace.”</p>

<p>“I wish you much happiness,” said Tiny, with
still another bow.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the queen, testing her
gauzy wings. “I learned yesterday from one of my
workers that Squirreltown is but a short distance
away. Follow the path leading eastward, and you
will be there in time for dinner.”</p>

<p>“And what a dinner I shall take to my good
mother!” exclaimed Tiny, looking about him.</p>

<p>There was his hunting bag filled with choice
acorns. Fully two bushels of beech-nuts and three
barrels of pine cones were scattered over the
ground. On the blackberry bushes, some of which
were five feet high, were at least a dozen gallons of
dried berries.</p>

<p>“I warn you that all is not well at Squirreltown,”
continued the queen. “They are having a dreadful
famine there, and your poor mother may have
starved by this time. Fear, want, and anxiety are
terrible companions with which to live.”</p>

<p>“What caused the famine?” asked Tiny in
alarm.</p>

<p>“Acorns and all the other queer food that squirrels
eat are very scarce in Squirreltown just now,”
explained the queen; “and, to make it all the worse,
the squirrels there were annoyed by a host of bears
that took up their abode in the city. As a result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
all the inhabitants were afraid to leave their homes.
The poor creatures were hungry enough to eat one
another.”</p>

<p>“Are there many bears about here?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p>“Quite a number of them came to the jungle,
because there are so many acorns. They intended
to hibernate here. I remembered how kind you had
been to me, so I sent messengers to all the bees for
miles around to drive the bears out of Squirreltown.
We intend to keep them out of this jungle.
We will watch your city every day and woe betide
the bear that enters! Should one attempt to pass
the city limits, an alarm will be sent out, and at
least a thousand bees will chase him until he falls
down exhausted. Bears, deer, and buffaloes are
cowards. However, they do look very dreadful to
small creatures like us.”</p>

<p>“I can never repay you for your courtesies,” said
Tiny, this time bowing so low that his bushy tail
looked like a canopy over his head.</p>

<p>“Now run along home before my army returns,”
continued the queen. “All the citizens of Squirreltown
know that you are coming, and that you are
their deliverer. I will send a few of my messengers
to guide you, and to conduct your friends back to
the jungle where they can eat all they want, and
store things for winter use. Goodby.”</p>

<p>The queen bee flew back into the stump, buzzing
happily. Tiny laughed, cried, chattered, and sang
for joy. After helping himself to a few berries and
pine cones, he picked up his bunting bag and
trudged along to Squirreltown, as happy as a king.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>The bees that had been sent to guide Tiny back
to Squirreltown did not speak a word. They flew
a short distance ahead of him, occasionally stopping
to rest or to take refreshment from the cup of a
wild rose.</p>

<p>What was Tiny’s joy when again he beheld the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
familiar trees of Squirreltown! His delight knew
no bounds when the squirrels, red, gray, and black,
scurried forth from their homes to welcome him.
Soon he was the center of an excited group. They
stroked his fur, pulled his beard, and shouted joyfully:</p>

<div id="Ref_58" class="figcenter" style="width: 594px;">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" width="594" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“WELCOME HOME! HURRAH FOR TINY REDSQUIRREL! LONG
LIFE TO THE DELIVERER OF SQUIRRELTOWN.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Welcome home! Hurrah for Tiny Redsquirrel!
Long life to the deliverer of Squirreltown!”</p>

<p>They were about to pounce upon his hunting bag,
but Tiny gently pushed them away, saying:</p>

<p>“These are for my mother. Shall I tell you
where I got them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” replied the squirrels, who were
almost starved.</p>

<p>“Follow those bees to a jungle not far distant,
where you can get enough provisions to last all
winter long. It is a dark and lonely place, but you
need have no fear, for a fairy queen lives there
who has promised to protect you. I will join you
soon.”</p>

<p>Although the squirrels were anxious to inquire
about Tiny’s health and to learn of his experience,
they immediately scampered off to the jungle, for
sometimes when little creatures become very
hungry they cease to be polite.</p>

<p>Tiny, finding himself all alone, hurried to his
home in the great oak tree. When he saw the face
of his dear mother, he was filled with mingled joy
and sorrow. She looked much older, for a few days
in Squirreltown is a very long time, and she had
been grieving constantly for her lost son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of rushing to embrace him, as one would
expect her to do, she ran rapidly about the room,
bounding over the table and chairs, shrieking and
making as much noise as possible, for that is the
way red squirrels show great joy.</p>

<p>“I am so glad that you have come back, my son!”
she cried again and again. “Tell me all about your
adventures, for you must have had many of them.”</p>

<div id="Ref_60" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" width="600" height="521" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE PULLED THE HUNTING BAG INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE
ROOM AND OPENED IT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Let us first have some supper, for you must be
almost starved,” said Tiny. He pulled the hunting
bag into the middle of the room, and opened it.</p>

<p>“Oh, how tempting!” cried his mother, sniffing
at the dried blackberries, and gazing hungrily at
the acorns and pine cones. “I have had nothing to
eat for two days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then let us have a good feast together,” said
Tiny, with a merry laugh. “While we are eating
I will tell you the story of my wanderings.”</p>

<p>“I shall eat while you are talking,” said Mrs.
Redsquirrel.</p>

<p>“But first I should like to know whether Chatty
Chipmunk is safe,” said Tiny anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Redsquirrel, with
a sigh. “Animals of the neighboring towns are
doing all they can to assist our city in finding him,
but so far they have had little encouragement. His
poor mother is ill from anxiety. No one in the
town suffers more than she.”</p>

<p>Tiny told his mother how he had become separated
from Chatty. He also told her about his
meeting with the various creatures of the forest.</p>

<p>“I think I may have been traveling in a circle
all the time,” he concluded.</p>

<p>“All bright, heavenly bodies travel in a circle,”
said his mother with pride. “At any rate I am glad
that you are safe at home once more. Now that we
have finished our meal, I will make the room more
tidy. Can I lift this hunting bag?”</p>

<p>“I will put it away,” answered Tiny, seizing the
bag and pulling it into the storeroom. “To-morrow
I will go out into the jungle and bring you enough
provisions to last all winter. Now, dear mother,
tell me what has happened in Squirreltown during
my absence.”</p>

<p>“On the day you left a number of bears took up
their abode in the heart of the city,” began Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Redsquirrel, with a shudder. “We squirrels could
do nothing. We tried to drive them away by throwing
twigs at them, but the dreadful things only
laughed at us, and said they would stay as long as
they lived. We couldn’t leave our homes to go out
into the country where the trees are loaded with
acorns and beech-nuts, so we stayed inside and
waited for help. The poor chipmunks in the ground
must have suffered more than we.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I was not here to comfort you,”
said Tiny.</p>

<p>“I missed you sorely, for you are so much braver
than I,” said Mrs. Redsquirrel meekly. “Last night
some of the older bears went away to get food.
Early this morning we heard a most terrible noise.
I peeped from my window and could see the bears
scattering in every direction, and could hear them
roaring and begging for mercy. Some of them fell
over logs and rolled helplessly about. In a few
moments they had all disappeared, and they did not
return. Presently an army of wee soldiers came to
the city, buzzing merrily, and settled down on that
old hemlock tree where the Flyingsquirrel family
formerly lived. Then Bushy Graysquirrel rushed
in to tell me that several maids of honor to the fairy
queen wanted to speak to me. She said that they
bore news from you.”</p>

<p>“How remarkable!” exclaimed Tiny. “It
sounds, indeed, like a fairy tale.”</p>

<p>“It was more like a bad dream to me,” declared
Mrs. Redsquirrel. “Between you and me I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
afraid to go down, and yet I wanted to hear something
about you. In a few minutes I had brushed
myself as neat as possible, and stood in the presence
of the queen’s army. A tiny maid of honor, with
shiny wings, came forth and told me how you had
saved the queen’s life. She said that she and her
soldiers had promised to keep their eyes on Squirreltown,
and how they would see that the bears
disturbed us no more. I was also assured that you
were well, and that you would be back soon. I
thanked her for her kindness, and returned home.
Squirreltown at once became the liveliest place you
ever saw. All the citizens mingled together as if
they belonged to one family, and they cheered
loudly for Tiny Redsquirrel, whom they called their
deliverer. They are planning to give you a party
late this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That will be delightful,” said Tiny, beginning
to feel very important. “Last night I saw a crown
of glittering stars circling about the tops of our
tallest trees. I never saw stars that shone brighter
than they.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I almost forgot to tell you the most interesting
part of the story,” replied Mrs. Redsquirrel.
“The queen doubtless knew that you would go to
some treetop, hoping to catch a glimpse of Squirreltown,
so she sent out some of her attendants to the
camp of the fireflies, to beg them to lend their aid.
Before long several thousand of the bright, pretty
creatures were circling about the tops of the oak
trees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“How wonderful!” exclaimed Tiny, with breathless
interest. “I did not know that such little
creatures could be so helpful.”</p>

<p>“Three times to-day several of the queen’s maids
of honor flew into my window and left me some
honey,” continued the mother. “I have grown
quite fond of honey, although I do not believe that
sweets are good for animals.”</p>

<p>Tiny then told his parent how the owl prophet
had taken an interest in him, and how he expected
to seek him soon to receive more knowledge.</p>

<p>“I do not put much dependence upon owls,” said
Mrs. Redsquirrel, beginning to tremble, “but,
should it be to your advantage, I would not complain
if you should go to thank him for his goodness.
He has been so kind that you ought not to
show ingratitude. Perhaps he may teach you many
other things that you should know.”</p>

<p>“May I lie down for a few moments, mother?”
asked Tiny, for he was beginning to feel the effects
of his long and tiresome journey.</p>

<p>“Dear son, you may,” she replied, as she hastened
to make his couch more comfortable. “You
ought to take a long nap before the party.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>Tiny became ill, and could not venture out of
doors, so the party was postponed until he should
get well. His mother sent for Dr. Flyingsquirrel,
who lived out in the country. The doctor, who
could spread out his loose skin and fly like a bird,
said that Tiny should remain quiet for at least two
days.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SEVERAL OF TINY’S BEST FRIENDS, INCLUDING THE MAYOR
HIMSELF, AND OTHER IMPORTANT CITIZENS CAME TO
SEE HIM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Mayor of Squirreltown issued an edict that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
anyone who made a loud noise should be banished
from the city, so intense silence reigned. Several
of Tiny’s best friends, including the mayor himself
and other important citizens, came to see him. They
brought him wild flowers, acorns fashioned by their
teeth into fanciful cups, and many other pretty
things which Tiny gratefully received.</p>

<p>The second morning Bushy Graysquirrel brought
him a book of fables written by Father Aesop, who
at that time was the greatest writer known to
Animal Kingdom.</p>

<p>The story that pleased him most was the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">THE MOUSE’S DISCOVERY.</p>

<p>Once upon a time a donkey, a wolf, a fox, and a
cat fell into an argument as to which of them was
the greatest.</p>

<p>A field mouse, who was hiding close by in a tuft
of grass, heard the conversation, and was much
amused.</p>

<p>“I am the greatest thing in the world,” boasted
the wolf, “for I am so brave that I fear nothing.
On the other hand, you would all run if I showed
my teeth and claws. I am one of man’s greatest
fears.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly no sign of greatness to be a good
fighter,” said the fox, proudly curling his tail as
foxes sometimes do. “I am shrewd and wily. It
is much better to have these qualities of mind than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to be fierce. Children’s books are full of stories
concerning my cunning tricks.”</p>

<p>“Foxes’ opinions of themselves are sometimes
absurd,” said the donkey, stamping his hoofs upon
the ground to scare away the flies. “Donkeys are
the greatest of all objects, for the reason that they
are useful and always can be depended upon.
Donkeys’ feet are more sure than the hoofs of
horses.”</p>

<p>“I am the chief of all objects,” proclaimed the
cat, from a bough of one of the birches. “I belong
to the tiger family, yet I am so gentle that children
keep me for a pet. Men prefer dogs, but cats are
women’s favorites. The wolf’s importance is small
compared with mine. My food is brought to me,
and I spend my spare time catching mice. Cats are
mice’s greatest foes.”</p>

<p>The mouse’s heart stood still when he heard these
dreadful words from the cat’s mouth, for he
dreaded cats’ paws more than he did wolves’ teeth.</p>

<p>“I cannot fight, nor am I shrewd enough to steal,
strong enough to carry loads, nor lazy enough to
be a child’s pet; but I can sing,” warbled a thrush
from the branch of another tree. “Birds are men’s
sweetest comforters, for their tunes always drive
away care. Flies’ lives are spent in useless buzzing.
A fly’s buzz is not sweet to hear, as the donkey well
knows. However, thrushes’ songs are very melodious,
for thrushes practice singing all day long.
Surely the thrush’s position is high above that of
all other objects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the wolf could open his mouth to praise
himself again, there was a sound of heavy footsteps.
Presently a man came in sight, carrying a blunderbuss.</p>

<p>The wolf, forgetting how brave he was, darted
away; the donkey’s departure was almost as sudden;
the thrush flew high into the sky; the cat
scurried to the birch’s topmost branch; and the
hair on the fox’s tail stood straight up as he leaped
the bushes.</p>

<p>“See how they run!” exclaimed the field mouse,
laughing at the frightened animals who a moment
since had been boasting of their power. “It is very
plain to be seen that the greatest of all objects is the
blunderbuss.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>When the two days were up Tiny had quite
regained his health. Great preparations had been
made for a jubilee. A grand banquet, given by the
mayor and other high
officials, was to be held
in the hollow of a big
tree.</p>

<p>When Tiny stepped
out upon the little
rustic veranda in
front of his home, he
observed that the
branches of the tree
below him were
thronged with squirrels
of all colors and of
all walks in life.</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Tiny
Redsquirrel!” they
shouted. “Welcome, deliverer of Squirreltown!
Three cheers for the noblest and bravest squirrel
of Animal Kingdom! A speech! A speech!”</p>

<div id="Ref_69" class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="350" height="416" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TINY BECAME OVERWHELMED BY A FEELING
OF IMPORTANCE&mdash;THERE WAS ALL
SQUIRRELTOWN AT HIS FEET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Strange to say, instead of being embarrassed,
Tiny became overwhelmed by a feeling of importance.
There was all Squirreltown at his feet, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the mayor and Billy Foxsquirrel, the noted
whistler. Tiny bowed very stiffly, while the squirrels
at the tops of their voices shouted lustily. He
looked down upon them just as the wise owl
prophet had gazed at him.</p>

<p>“Fellow citizens,” he began, “I thank you for
the honor you do me. I see many faces before me
that show appreciation for what I have done to
rescue our city from the bears. I choose to do all I
can to help you.</p>

<p>“The mayor invited me to make a speech to you.
At the time, I knew that I could not prepare one as
well as he, but I threw myself into the task and did
the best I could. I am glad that this public reception
has drawn so many of you to this place.</p>

<p>“You have given me great happiness. Our
beautiful city has grown very dear to me. I am
glad that I was driven all round the world, for I
learned many things that I will teach you. I have
become much wiser since I have traveled, and have
learned much that you do not know. I&mdash;”</p>

<p>But in the midst of his grand eloquence, Tiny
was interrupted. As he stood beating the air with
his little paws, trying to impress his hearers, there
came a flapping of wings overhead.</p>

<p>His terrified hearers fled in all directions, but
before he could escape he was seized and borne high
into the air&mdash;up, up amongst the tree-tops.</p>

<p>He was too much frightened to cry out. He could
only wait until the dreadful creature that held him
in his clutches should set him free. His blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
almost froze in his veins. He wondered what he
should do if his frail limbs were broken, or if he
should be cast down in some lonely place to perish.
Perhaps he would be eaten. His heart fell within
him.</p>

<p>After traveling for some time in this unusual and
uncomfortable manner, he found himself in a nest
of great size, with the owl prophet staring at him
with big yellow eyes.</p>

<div id="Ref_71" class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A NEST OF HUGE SIZE,
WITH THE OWL PROPHET STARING AT
HIM WITH BIG, YELLOW EYES.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Although he was in a quiver of fright, like many
other small creatures, he did not wish to appear
concerned, so he smiled feebly and said:</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>“How dare you be so bold?” cried the owl in a
dry, unnatural voice. “Do you think I am a telephone?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said Tiny weakly. “My grammar
is very bad.”</p>

<p>“Grammar is never bad,” corrected the owl. “It
is your English that is bad.”</p>

<p>“But why did you take me away from dear old
Squirreltown?” wailed Tiny.</p>

<p>“To teach you the lesson of humility,” replied
the owl prophet. “I have flown all the way to
Squirreltown and back here to keep you from disgracing
yourself. I am glad that I went. To see
little Tiny Redsquirrel, puffed with vanity, frisking
about with his little paws and bushy tail, lecturing
to the old citizens of Squirreltown, was enough
to make a wise owl laugh. What do you suppose
the mayor thought of you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Tiny, ashamed of himself
in spite of his excitement. “I fear that I was
very pompous; but then I had delivered Squirreltown
from the bears, and I thought I had a right to
be bold. You see, the mayor intended to have me
for supper.”</p>

<p>“If you complain any more, I myself will have
you for supper,” declared the owl, with no pity
whatever. “I suppose you mean that the mayor
intended to entertain you at supper, for it is not
likely that he would wish to eat you.”</p>

<p>Tiny stared in bewilderment. He could not understand
all the odd sayings of the prophet, but,
nevertheless, he corrected himself by saying:</p>

<p>“The mayor invited me to eat supper with him.”</p>

<p>“Well, he will have all the more to eat without
you, and will not have to listen to any more of your
speeches,” snapped the owl. “Which one of those
squirrels was the mayor?”</p>

<p>“The large one with the sleek fur. I have often
been told that the mayor looks like I do,” replied
Tiny, his new vanity again appearing.</p>

<p>“To be sure he does,” retorted the owl, with a
laugh. “I, too, look like you do.”</p>

<p>Tiny again stared in astonishment. He could see
no points of resemblance between himself and the
owl.</p>

<p>“A bee looks like you do,” continued the prophet.
“A bear looks like you do; so does a weasel, an
elephant, a hyena, a jay bird, and a loon; even a
monkey looks like you do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are jesting with me,” protested Tiny, beginning
to be vexed.</p>

<p>“All animals look like you do, because they look
with their eyes just as you do,” said the owl, with
another distracting screech.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Tiny, good-naturedly. “I
should have said that the mayor looks like <em>me</em>. It
was incorrect for me to say that the mayor looks
like I do.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” said the owl, less harshly. “You are
a bright little creature, and I am going to see that
your wish for knowledge is granted. You felt very
important an hour ago, when you tried to make a
public speech before the oldest citizens of Squirreltown;
but now you see how little you know. I am
going to take you to Beaver Creek, where you may
complete your education. Very few animals of
the wood know of this school, and only the ablest
ones are admitted to it. When you have graduated,
you may go back to Squirreltown. Perhaps by that
time you will be able to make a modest speech before
your fellow squirrels.”</p>

<p>“I really want an education,” replied Tiny, with
enthusiasm. “The schools at Squirreltown are not
very good, and very few squirrels attend them. We
are such nervous creatures, and care more for play
than for study. But what will my mother do without
me?”</p>

<p>“If she is a good mother, she will not stand in the
way of your education,” replied the owl. “I will
write her a letter which the messenger pigeon, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
friend of mine, will carry to her. You must write
to her twice a week, and the messenger pigeon will
bear the letters to her.”</p>

<p>“I dislike to write letters,” protested Tiny. “It
is such stupid work.”</p>

<p>“It is generally a stupid creature that dislikes to
write letters,” said the owl severely. “He does not
like to write, because he does not know how to write
well. In Miss Hare’s School at Beaver Creek, you
will be taught how to write correctly; then letter
writing will prove to be a great pleasure to you.”</p>

<p>“I am anxious to attend this school, because I
want to learn how to read stories and to count,”
said Tiny, after a moment of anxious thought.</p>

<p>“You must promise to work hard,” said the owl,
earnestly. “You will find pupils at this school from
all parts of Animal Kingdom. Miss Hare is a good
instructor, but very strict. If you should do anything
that would injure one of your classmates, you
would be drowned in the creek. Now roll yourself
into a little round
ball again, for I am
ready to start.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;">

</div>

<p>Tiny did as he
was commanded.
The owl almost encircled
him with his
long claws, and
away they went to a
strange land, about
which Tiny had
never even dreamed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>As he flew through the air in the clutches of the
owl, Tiny realized what a small, helpless creature
he was. Not a word was spoken till they stopped at
the bank of a creek, which looked to him like a great
river. It was filled, in one place, with branches of
willows, beeches, poplars, and other trees. His
heart beat sluggishly, for the scene was very dismal,
indeed.</p>

<p>“Have no fear,” said the owl prophet, not so
gruffly as usual. “I have promised the queen bee to
help you. A great many creatures do not like to go
to school, but in after years they always regret it
if they have quit school before completing the
course.”</p>

<p>Not a sound could be heard except the babbling of
the brook and the tinkling of a waterfall several
rods away. Tiny shuddered, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“These buildings were built by beavers,” explained
the owl, although it was so dark Tiny could
not see them at all. “When they moved away, Miss
Hare started her school here. Only one of the
beavers remained. He is a skilled carpenter and
janitor, and he keeps the building in good repair.
You no doubt have heard that he mixes mortar with
his forepaws, and uses his broad tail for a trowel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Young beavers stay at home till they are three
years old; then they build houses of their own.
This school is situated upon a stream of flowing
water, as you see, for Miss Hare thinks that little
scholars should have plenty of water as well as
fresh air.”</p>

<div id="Ref_78" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="600" height="631" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“THE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT BY BEAVERS,” EXPLAINED THE
OWL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“I am glad that I came,” said Tiny, although he
looked into the owl’s yellow eyes with some distrust.
He still feared that the wise prophet might
suddenly pounce upon him and eat him.</p>

<p>“Hoot! hoot! hoot! Is everybody asleep?” cried
the wise owl. “I can’t see why creatures want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sleep at night. I never close my eyes then, for I
have plenty of sleep in the daytime. Besides, one
should always be on the lookout at night, for one
never knows what may happen.”</p>

<p>Soon there was a splashing in the water, and in
a few moments a queer animal approached them.</p>

<p>“It is the janitor,” explained the owl, somewhat
annoyed by the delay. “I fear he is getting lazy.
He surely is not overworked, for all he does is to
look after the buildings, play, sleep, and eat the
bark of trees and the roots of water lilies.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon for keeping you waiting so long,”
said the beaver. “As soon as I heard you, I rose to
find out your wish.”</p>

<p>“I have brought a pupil to Miss Hare,” said the
owl. “Please see that he has a comfortable room
for the night. Tell Miss Hare that I will write her
a letter soon.”</p>

<p>The owl prophet flew away, leaving Tiny with the
beaver, who moved sleepily back along the willow
boughs to a group of quaint houses made of mud,
stones, and sticks. Their dome-shaped roofs were
several feet above the level of the water.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the front window of one of the
houses, a gleam of light shot forth and an odd-looking
animal thrust out its head.</p>

<p>Tiny, who by this time was accustomed to surprises,
looked up to behold Miss Hare gazing down
upon him. She looked very comical in her white
nightcap.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well, what is the matter?” she cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in a high voice. “My nerves are shaken by the
dreadful noises I have heard. What is the matter,
Mr. Beaver?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Owl has brought another pupil,” said the
beaver, politely. “I do not know where to put
him.”</p>

<div id="Ref_80" class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="453" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“MR. OWL HAS BROUGHT ANOTHER PUPIL,” SAID
THE BEAVER, POLITELY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Let him stay with Reynard Redfox to-night,”
replied Miss Hare, looking searchingly at Tiny.
“What a frail little creature you are! You must
belong to the Rat family.”</p>

<p>Tiny did not like Miss Hare’s frank way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
speaking, and to be compared to a rat was not
agreeable, but he said politely:</p>

<p>“I am Tiny Redsquirrel of Squirreltown. I desire
very much to get an education.”</p>

<p>“I will let you stay if you will obey the rules,”
said Miss Hare, severely. “I have always heard
that red squirrels are very mischievous animals.
You must know that I will not permit any foolishness.
Not long ago Mr. Owl brought a pupil here
who was so very saucy and naughty that I was glad
to get rid of him. Although I taught him the lessons
of kindness and charity, he bit Weenie Mouse
and hit Winkie Weasel with an acorn. One day he
tore out one of Katie Goose’s feathers and frightened
the poor fowl almost to death. I never before
saw such a bad creature. He looked very much like
you. Do you know Chatty Chipmunk?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Tiny, heartily ashamed of
his youthful companion. “Is he at this school?”</p>

<p>“No, he forsook us before he had been here three
days,” answered Miss Hare. “I think he must
have been drowned. I will give you a trial; but if
you prove unworthy of my school I will never receive
any more pupils brought to me by Mr. Owl.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the beaver. “I will take you to
meet your roommate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I cannot room with a red fox!” protested
Tiny, much alarmed. “He will eat me during his
sleep.”</p>

<p>“You need have no fear,” said the beaver assuringly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“Miss Hare has taught all her pupils the
lesson of self-denial. She puts all sorts of temptations
in their way, but none of them ever yield unless
they are downright bad, as Chatty Chipmunk
was. Reynard Redfox is very well bred. He and
Bantam Chicken are the best of friends. Wherever
you see Bantam, you may also see Reynard
following after him.”</p>

<p>Tiny did not feel very comfortable when the
beaver opened the door of one of the buildings and
told him to enter.</p>

<p>Three or four fireflies, whose duty it was to carry
lanterns, flew about the room, making it very light.
Reynard Redfox, who was very large compared
with Tiny, rose and shook out his stiff, long-haired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
coat. He gazed hungrily at the little red squirrel
as though he were starving for his companionship.</p>

<div id="Ref_82" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="600" height="535" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“MR. REDFOX, THIS IS MR. REDSQUIRREL,” SAID THE
BEAVER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Mr. Redfox, this is Mr. Redsquirrel,” said the
beaver. “Mr. Redsquirrel is a new scholar and
Miss Hare said he should share your room to-night.”</p>

<p>“He is most welcome,” said Reynard with a
smile that made Tiny tremble all over. “I always
was fond of squirrels. I fancy we shall get along
famously together, as he takes up so little room.”</p>

<p>“I assure you I shall occupy as little space as
possible,” replied Tiny, politely. “I shall sleep
here by the door, and, if I annoy you during the
night, all you have to do is to make a noise and I
will jump into the creek.”</p>

<p>“You are quite safe,” assured the fox, settling
himself for a nap. “Since I have been at this
school I have learned how cowardly it is to injure
creatures smaller and weaker than myself. I hope
you will like our school.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, too,” said Tiny, faintly. “Of course,
it will take time to get acquainted with all the
strange animals I shall meet. I have seen little
of the world.”</p>

<p>“Just be kind and unselfish, and you will make
friends,” said the red fox. “When you see another
animal that doesn’t please you, don’t stare at him
as you did at me, but be as agreeable as you can.
Remember that it would be a very monotonous
world if all animals should look and act alike.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Hare must be a very nice creature,” ventured
Tiny.</p>

<p>“She is very wise and talented,” said the fox
with enthusiasm. “Some of the most aristocratic
families in Animal Kingdom are represented in
her school. I have heard that she belongs to the
nobility. You know she is a Belgian Hare, and I
believe I heard some one say that her father was a
Welsh Rabbit.”</p>

<p>At that moment a terrible thumping sound was
heard.</p>

<p>“What is that!” exclaimed Tiny, unconsciously
drawing nearer to Reynard for protection.</p>

<p>“It is a warning for us to keep quiet,” said the
fox. “Billy Beaver, the janitor, makes that noise
with his tail whenever we become boisterous at
night. You know that whenever a beaver wishes to
warn his companions that danger is near, he makes
a thumping sound with his tail. Really, the only
clever thing about a beaver is his tail.”</p>

<p>The fireflies settled down to rest, leaving the
roommates in darkness. Although Reynard slept
soundly, Tiny did not close his eyes until he was so
exhausted that he could keep them open no longer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>Tiny was glad when the rosy dawn peeped over
the eastern hills once more. The little dark room
in which he lay did not look so cheerless in the
bright light of day.</p>

<p>Again there came the sound of knocking that resembled
the beating of a drum.</p>

<div id="Ref_85" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_085.jpg" width="600" height="577" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“THAT’S BILLY BEAVER,” EXPLAINED REYNARD
REDFOX, YAWNING. “HE IS CALLING FOR US
TO GET UP.”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“That is Billy Beaver,” again explained Reynard
Redfox, yawning. “He is calling for us to get
up. We have just an hour in which to eat our
breakfasts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who gets breakfast for us?” asked Tiny, feeling
much out of place in the strange new land.</p>

<p>“Each one gets his own breakfast, of course,”
replied Reynard, much amused. “We all require
different kinds of food; and Miss Hare does not
care how or where we get it, if we keep from injuring
one another.”</p>

<p>“Katie Goose, who is very cleanly, takes a swim
in the creek, and hunts for seeds along the bank;
Sammy Rabbit, a relative of Miss Hare, hunts for
grain; and Winkie Weasel chases insects and
catches frogs. Since I have become civilized, I
am particularly fond of grapes, although I am
never so happy as when strawberry season comes
round.</p>

<p>“Shifty Woodchuck has less trouble in searching
for his breakfast than any other pupil, for he
goes to a field of red clover or wild buckwheat, and
many a time he eats until he is not in good condition
to study. Shifty is a sleepy little animal. He
spends the winter in a nest of dried grasses that he
builds in a hole in the ground. When the cold
weather comes, he will get sleepy and will lay aside
his studies to prepare for a long rest. Maybe he
will sleep all winter, for no other animal sleeps so
long or so soundly as the woodchuck.”</p>

<p>It took Tiny but a few moments to smooth down
his silken fur and to brush out his bushy tail. With
a shrill cry of delight, he sprang from his new
home and ran out into the bracing, frosty air. He
sped over the willow brush that surrounded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
village of quaint beaver houses, and soon found
himself in an oak tree where there were plenty of
ripe acorns, moist with dew.</p>

<p>Hardly had he finished his breakfast when again
he heard the tail of the beaver pounding heavily.
He hastened back to the cluster of beaver houses
with their round domes. Little animals of all kinds
were bustling about on their way to the various
recitation rooms. Billy Beaver, the janitor, told
Tiny that he should go into the auditorium, which
was the largest building of all. There he found
Miss Hare, sitting behind a rough, wooden table.
She wore a gray robe and a pair of large earrings.
Her spectacles were so heavy that her eyes seemed
very large; but he at once decided that she must be
a kind teacher, as her voice was soft and gentle.</p>

<p>A number of animals sat on wooden benches facing
Miss Hare. Reynard Redfox, who was the
largest animal in school, sat in one corner by himself.
His big, dark eyes were as mild as Tiny’s.
His coarse, shaggy fur was neatly brushed.</p>

<p>The room was decorated with flowers and carpeted
with moss. An old-fashioned fireplace with
bellows and tongs stood at one end of the room.
Tiny, who had never before seen a fireplace, wondered
where the fire came from. He afterwards
learned that Billy Beaver made the fire by rubbing
two sticks together, and that it was never permitted
to go out.</p>

<p>Toadstools, cat-tails, and elderberry bushes were
arranged against the walls, looking quite as artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
as the bay-trees and other ornaments we see in
fashionable hotels. Window curtains, woven of
silk by spiders, and screens and cushions, woven of
weeds, reeds, and grass by birds and mice, added to
the comfort of the place. Snail shells and pretty
stones, gathered by the pupils, also lent beauty to
the room.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">NOT WISHING TO BE OUTDONE BY HIS
CLASSMATES, HE WENT FORWARD AND,
WITH A LOW BOW, GAVE MISS HARE
AN ACORN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tiny observed that
each pupil presented
the teacher with flowers
and delicacies,
which were laid on
her desk. Not wishing
to be outdone by his
classmates, he went
forward and, with a
low bow, gave Miss
Hare an acorn.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said
Miss Hare with a
pleased smile, as she
bent forward and
gazed admiringly at
him through her dark spectacles. “I see that you
have already learned the lesson of generosity. You
are the little animal that Mr. Owl brought here last
night, I suppose. I hope you will be very studious
and learn a great deal. I will introduce you to
two pupils in the language class. Mr. Redsquirrel,
this pupil is Winkie Weasel; that pupil just coming
in is Sammy Rabbit. Those pupils, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sitting in the back row of seats, are well advanced
in their work; those pupils in the front seats are
beginners. I will introduce them later on.”</p>

<p>Tiny bowed to each of the pupils in the room,
which included Shifty Woodchuck, who was very
fat and sleepy-looking; Mr. Rabbitt, who had pink
eyes and rosy ears; Mew Mew, who wore a blue
bow; Bow Wow, with curly locks hanging over his
eyes; Little Winkie Weasel, who possessed a long
body and very short legs; Miss Field Mouse, who
sat upon a toadstool; and several other pupils.</p>

<p>“I usually teach in rhyme,” said Miss Hare,
with an air of assurance that made Tiny think she
was vastly learned. “I teach the multiplication
table in rhyme, and in language I teach the use of
verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech in the same
way. There is no reason why one should not
teach in rhyme, for it is natural and not easily
forgotten.”</p>

<p>She then told Tiny to sit by Winkie Weasel
and, after opening her book, she looked over the
class to be sure that each pupil was ready to give
his attention.</p>

<p>“The class may read aloud together our lesson
for to-day,” she said, finally.</p>

<p>All the animals rose and read as follows:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>Miss Hare’s school was a very studious place
during the fall; but when winter set in, some of the
pupils began to lose interest in their work. The
woodchuck, who was the dullest pupil in the language
class, went to his bed
of dried clover one night
and forgot to wake up until
spring had returned.
Tiny, himself, felt very
sleepy at times, but he sat
close to the fireplace in the
schoolroom and studied as
hard as he could, determined
to get a good education.
He did his work
well. At recess-time he
would run out upon the
pile of branches that surrounded
the school building,
and play until Miss Hare rang the bell. Sometimes
he would run a race with Winkie Weasel, but,
as he always came out ahead, he soon wearied of
the pastime.</p>

<div id="Ref_95" class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" width="250" height="336" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SOMETIMES HE WOULD RUN A RACE
WITH WINKIE WEASEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At dusk he would go to his cozy room, and for an
hour or more he and Reynard would talk over their
lessons and their plans for the future. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
no pretty fireflies to make light for them, but, when
the moon was shining, they could see quite well.
They grew contented to lie in their soft beds of
leaves and reeds, and talk about the coming of
spring.</p>

<p>One cold night they heard a knock. Reynard,
who was feeling homesick, opened the door. There
stood Puss Snowball, the cat, looking very beautiful
against the pure white background of ice and
snow, upon which the moon shone brightly.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Snowball,” said Reynard, kindly.
“Will you not come in?”</p>

<p>“I thought I would run over and have a little
chat with you,” said Snowball, nestling down in
the coziest corner of the room. “My, isn’t it cold!
I believe I have frozen my whiskers and the tip of
my nose.”</p>

<p>“Cold weather doesn’t last always,” said Tiny,
cheerily. “Reynard and I do our work quite as
well in cold weather as in warm weather. If it
were not for the ice and snow, we would not take
so much delight in the green grass and the spring
rains.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” said Snowball, his teeth chattering,
“but I shouldn’t mind the cold weather if
I had a more agreeable companion. I can’t understand
why Miss Hare insists upon my rooming
with Rover. You know cats and dogs never get
along well.”</p>

<p>“If you were too happy together, perhaps you
would forget to study,” suggested Reynard. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
remember, Snowball, how the monkey and the parrot
became so sociable that they had to leave
School.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Rover is very mannerly in some ways, but
he growls and barks too much,” complained Snowball,
with a sigh. “They say it is natural for a dog
to bark, although I can’t see why he need be so
noisy about it. He frightens me almost to death
when he barks, and he is very unreasonable. To-night
he has done many things to tease me. The
other night he told me that my constant purring
was very trying to his nerves. You know that a cat
never purs unless he is happy, so I suppose that my
good nature makes him cross. How peculiar some
animals are!”</p>

<p>Tiny said that every creature has its peculiarities,
and it is best to overlook things that do not
please us, since we all have disagreeable traits of
our own.</p>

<p>“We wanted to organize a singing class,” continued
Snowball, changing the subject, “but when
we called in Katie Goose to talk it over with us,
Billy Beaver thrust his nose through the door and
said that Miss Hare would never permit us to sing
after night. He added that a cat, a dog, a goose,
and a number of other creatures, would not make
a very tuneful chorus, however fine we might be as
soloists.”</p>

<p>“Billy Beaver can’t sing,” said Reynard. “I
can see his reason for objecting to a students’
chorus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“He is very rude,” said Snowball, severely. “I
shall not forget how horrid he made me feel the
night that Weenie Mouse was missing. I am sure
that he thought I might have eaten him. I was very
glad, indeed, when they found Weenie hiding in
Miss Hare’s room, nibbling at an ear of corn.”</p>

<p>“Recite the poem about the kitten that went to
sleep when her mother had visitors,” begged Tiny.
“I am sure that Reynard would like to hear it.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Reynard to insist, Snowball
recited, in his pretty purring manner, the following
poem, which is said to amuse kittens even to
the present day:</p>


<p class="center p1 poemheader">TABBY AND PRUE.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Quoth Dame Tabby Cat to her daughter, Miss Prue,
</div><div class="indent1">“I shall teach you a lesson, my dear,
</div><div class="indent0">For I am so very much older than you,
</div><div class="indent1">And very much wiser, I fear.
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">“I felt more ashamed than I ever can tell,
</div><div class="indent1">When you slept while my callers were here.
</div><div class="indent0">If you do it again, I will punish you well;
</div><div class="indent1">I will teach you some manners, my dear.”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">“Shall I sit wide awake while your busy tongues fly?
</div><div class="indent1">Can I keep my eyes open so long?”
</div><div class="indent0">“You can, Prudy dear, if you only will try,
</div><div class="indent1">But you think it is smart to do wrong.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">The anger of Tabby Cat grew quite intense,
</div><div class="indent1">When Prue said, “Please listen, I pray.
</div><div class="indent0">May I speak a few words in my own self-defense?”
</div><div class="indent1">And Tabby Cat answered, “You may.”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">“I ought not to sleep till your friends go away.
</div><div class="indent1">Such an act is a sorry mishap;
</div><div class="indent0">Yet you taught me to do it, for only to-day
</div><div class="indent1">You talked yourself into a nap.”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">“My friends stayed so long that I hardly could peep,”
</div><div class="indent1">Said Tabby Cat, heaving a sigh;
</div><div class="indent0">“But, nevertheless, <em>you</em> must not fall fast asleep,
</div><div class="indent1">For you are much younger than I.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“It is a capital story,” laughed Reynard, when
Snowball had finished. “I saw Tiny laughing
many times.”</p>

<p>Before the squirrel could thank the cat for his
kindness, Billy Beaver pounded at the door, and in
another moment stood before them.</p>

<p>“I overheard you talking about me, Mr. Snowball;
also about Rover and others,” he said, turning
to the cat, who, in the moonlight, looked very
pale and frightened.</p>

<p>“Did I understand you to say that you were
eavesdropping?” Snowball finally inquired, with a
show of dignity.</p>

<p>“It is no worse to eavesdrop than it is to gossip
about one’s closest friends,” replied the beaver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
“I have seen Miss Hare. I told her that you were
not pleased with your roommate, and she has ordered
me to make a change. In the future you shall
room with Weenie Mouse.”</p>

<p>“How terrible!” exclaimed Puss, greatly
shocked. “I shall be under restraint all the time.
Poor Rover! Perhaps he has had his hard times,
too. What if I should get vexed at Weenie and
swallow him?”</p>

<p>“Miss Hare says that you will never do that, because
her pupils are too strong to yield to temptation,”
said the beaver, seriously.</p>

<p>“But why does Miss Hare punish poor Weenie
by making him room with a cat?” gasped Puss.</p>

<p>“Because Weenie was found in Miss Hare’s pantry
again, helping himself to corn and other dainties,”
replied Billy Beaver. “Miss Hare wishes
you to room with Weenie so that you can restrain
each other. The best way to cure two disturbers who
dislike each other is to make them live together.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>The little animals of Miss Hare’s school were
glad when winter was at an end. They were anxious
to get out of doors; and, when the sun shone
warmer and the trees began to shoot forth their
tender leaves, they felt very happy, indeed.</p>

<div id="Ref_101" class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" width="300" height="322" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TINY STUDIED HARD, THAT HE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GRADUATE
WITH HIS CLASS IN THE MONTH
OF JUNE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tiny studied hard, that
he might be able to graduate
with his class in the
month of June. He knew
that to graduate did not
mean to be educated. A
thorough knowledge of
language and good manners
were about all that
Miss Hare was capable of
teaching, for the little
creatures of Animal Kingdom
did not require as
much learning as people of the great business
world. Miss Hare told her pupils many times that
the schoolroom is simply a place to teach the young
how to educate themselves. Tiny, from past experience,
had learned that some of the greatest lessons
are taught outside the schoolroom. He often
thought of the owl prophet, the queen bee, and the
City of Ants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Miss Hare gave her pupils a lesson in
pronouns, or words used for names. These little
words were at first troublesome to Tiny, but Miss
Hare made him use them over and over again, until
he understood them perfectly. In fact, the
words <em>I</em>, <em>we</em>, <em>she</em>, <em>they</em>, <em>who</em>, and <em>it</em>, used as subjects
of sentences, and <em>me</em>, <em>us</em>, <em>him</em>, <em>her</em>, <em>them</em>, and
<em>whom</em>, used as the objects of verbs, became almost
as familiar to Tiny as were good Miss Hare’s spectacles.</p>

<p>In order to keep her pupils from forgetting what
they had learned, Miss Hare taught them the following
little song, which they sang over and over
again:</p>


<p class="center p1 poemheader">PRONOUNS.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">As the subject of a verb, we may use <em>I</em>;
</div><div class="indent0">Thus, “It was <em>I</em>,” or “<em>I</em> have caught a fly;”
</div><div class="indent3">And we now will name a few
</div><div class="indent3">Pronouns used as subjects, too:
</div><div class="indent0">“It was <em>they</em>,” “It was <em>you</em>,” “It was <em>who</em>?”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">We may ask, “<em>Who</em> saw the bee upon the rose?”
</div><div class="indent0">Or, “<em>It</em> was dressed in very modest clothes,”
</div><div class="indent3">Or, “<em>Who</em> scared the little bee?”
</div><div class="indent3">“Was it any of us three?”
</div><div class="indent0">“Was it <em>we</em>?” “Was it <em>she</em>?” “Was it <em>he</em>?”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">Pronouns may be used as objects, you may see;
</div><div class="indent0">As, “Good health has kindly favored <em>him</em> and <em>me</em>.”
</div><div class="indent3">Or, “No matter what we do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
</div><div class="indent3">Love will make <em>us</em> strong and true;”
</div><div class="indent0">“I love <em>her</em>,” “I love <em>him</em>,” “I love <em>you</em>.”
</div><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="indent0">We may ask, “From <em>whom</em> did owls learn to boast?”
</div><div class="indent0">Or, “Around <em>whom</em> does the sunshine linger most?”
</div><div class="indent3">Or, perchance, may cry in glee,
</div><div class="indent3">“May good fortune come to <em>thee</em>,
</div><div class="indent0">And to <em>her</em>, and to <em>him</em>, and to <em>me</em>!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>While they were singing their evening song, a
knock was heard at the door. Miss Hare, who was
very cautious, went to the door and called out:</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Hoot, hoot, hoot!” was the response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“To whom am I speaking?” continued the
teacher, somewhat embarrassed.</p>

<p>“To Mr. Owl, who lives several leagues away,”
was the polite reply.</p>

<p>“Whom do you wish to see?” asked Miss Hare.</p>

<p>“I wish to visit Miss Hare’s school.”</p>

<div id="Ref_103" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" width="600" height="510" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND ADMITTED THE OWL PROPHET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>She opened the door and admitted the owl
prophet, whose feathers were smoothed down in
perfect condition.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you,” said the teacher.
“It is so seldom you go abroad in the daytime that
I am honored to have you visit us.”</p>

<p>“Between you and me, I have long been wishing
for an opportunity to visit your school,” returned
the owl with a bow.</p>

<p>“With whom are you living now?” asked Miss
Hare, offering him a perch by the side of her desk.</p>

<p>“My brother and I are living with the Bat family.
I grew tired of my old castle, because it was at
the edge of the great forest, and the wind was too
strong there. One night he and I were blown from
our perches. Mr. and Mrs. Bat took my brother
and me to their home. It is very comfortable there,
and we owls like comfort, you know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Owl then looked over the class with his great,
yellow eyes. For the first time, Tiny observed that
owls’ eyes do not move in their sockets as the eyes
of most creatures do; but that, to make up for that,
nature has made it possible for the owl to turn his
head almost entirely around to see objects. Miss
Hare’s eyes were quite different from those of Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Owl; for she had no eyelids, and Tiny had learned
that, when she slept, a thin white membrane covered
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you remain awhile with my pupils and
me?” asked Miss Hare.</p>

<p>“Thank you; I’ll stay a few minutes, if I don’t
get too sleepy,” said Mr. Owl.</p>

<p>When his eyes fell upon Tiny, the little squirrel
made a polite bow; but the owl prophet stared at
him without speaking a word. He evidently did
not remember the squirrel.</p>

<p>“What has become of Chatty Chipmunk?” he
finally asked, after Miss Hare had again sat down
at her desk.</p>

<p>“He left school some time ago,” said Miss Hare,
in a pained voice.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because it was necessary to punish him. He
was very saucy. Once he ridiculed an animal because
she had long ears.”</p>

<p>“Whom did he ridicule?”</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry for that,” said the owl prophet.
“Who punished him?”</p>

<p>“I.”</p>

<p>“It served him right, and I am glad he left
school,” said the owl, flapping his wings in approval.
“It makes no difference to either you or
me.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, not,” replied Miss Hare. “He is to
blame, not I. The public must blame him, not me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope that I never shall bring you another
such unworthy pupil,” said the owl.</p>

<p>“You brought me one of the best pupils I ever
had,” said Miss Hare, pointing towards Tiny. “He
is the little creature here on the front seat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Owl stared at Tiny; and the little animal
bowed politely, very much embarrassed.</p>

<div id="Ref_106" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MR. OWL STARED AT TINY AND THE LITTLE ANIMAL BOWED
POLITELY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Can it be he!” exclaimed the owl. “How you
have grown, Tiny! Are you really the squirrel
whom I found but a few months ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am the squirrel who was lost,” replied
Tiny. “You told me how to get back to Squirreltown,
and taught me many things. I am grateful
to you, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Owl seemed greatly pleased, but he checked
Tiny’s polite thanks by saying:</p>

<p>“You look much like Chatty Chipmunk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he is smaller than I,” replied Tiny
with another bow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>For a few minutes Miss Hare and Mr. Owl talked
concerning the school. It was evident to Tiny that
Mr. Owl was one of the trustees and that he was
doing a great deal to make the school successful,
as all trustees should do.</p>

<p>At last he turned to the class and said:</p>

<p>“You must all study very hard; for soon the
days will get warmer; then you will have spring
fever. I want each of the graduating class to write
a composition to be recited on the last day of school.
A prize will be given to the pupil who writes the
best one. He that wins the prize will be a very
happy creature. Him that wins I will give another
prize of even greater value.”</p>

<p>The scholars were made very happy by this announcement
of Mr. Owl; and, while he was preparing
to leave, they all rose from their seats and stood
in respectful silence until Miss Hare sat down
again. Then they began to study harder than ever
before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>When Tiny learned to write letters, he spent
many happy hours corresponding with his mother
and his friends at Squirreltown. Almost every
day a messenger pigeon
brought him a letter,
which he read with great
pleasure. Here are a few
of these letters that passed
between Beaver Creek and
Squirreltown:</p>

<p>My Dear Mother:</p>

<p>While you were sleeping
away the long, cold
winter, I was studying
with all my might, trying
to keep at the head of my
class.</p>

<p>I like Beaver Creek very much. Miss Hare is
a good and capable teacher. I shall be sorry to
graduate from here in June, and yet I am anxious
to get back to Squirreltown again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The spring flowers are blooming all about Beaver
Creek. I wish you could see how beautiful they
are. The daisy, which is like a white star, opens
with the morning sun. The morning glory shuts
up its sweet petals before noon. The dandelion
opens early, but closes when the heat becomes too
great. The anemone, so blue and so fragile, sleeps
at the approach of a storm; while the water lily
curls up and hides itself in the mud at the bottom
of the pond. The marsh marigold is a hardy little
flower. It drinks, drinks, drinks, from morning
till night, pleased with any kind of weather.</p>

<p>I will tell you more about the beauties of Beaver
Creek, one of these days. In the meantime, please
write and tell me about dear old Squirreltown.</p>

<p>I feel so sorry for the Chipmunks. They are all,
with the exception of Chatty, such active, industrious
creatures. I fear he will never outlive the bad
habits formed in his early youth. He does little
but sleep in his round room at the end of the long
hall, and eat large quantities of beechnuts.</p>

many acorns, and be sure to keep your fur clean
and smooth.</p>

<p>Dear Friend:</p>

<p>I received your jolly letter, and I am going to
show my appreciation by sending an early reply.</p>

<p>Sister Peggy and I are spending a few days with
our friend, Polly Blacksquirrel. We are all well,
after our long winter’s nap, and are enjoying ourselves
greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The other day, Polly took Peggy and me down to
the pond to hear a famous orchestra. We sat upon
a mossy seat close to the blue water, and patiently
waited until all the musicians had come out of the
water and had taken their seats on the green lily
pads. The leader of the band was very pompous,
and his white vest was covered with medals. I had
to laugh at the airs he put on.</p>

<p>The musicians, of course, were frogs, and they all
wore green coats and white vests. They looked so
odd with their bulging eyes and swelling throats!
One large bull frog played a bass viol. He was a
savage fellow, and, frequently, he would go down
into the water to eat poor little tadpoles.</p>

<p>Now you know that gray squirrels are more fond
of music than are any other kind of squirrel; but,
so far as I am concerned, I do not like to be too
close to a frog orchestra.</p>

<p>Is it not queer that frogs and fishes, both of
which live in the water, are so unlike? Polly’s
father said that if a frog keeps his mouth open very
long, he will die; while a fish has to keep his mouth
open most of the time to permit his breathing organs
to act properly.</p>

<p>Peggy and Polly join me in sending you our
kindest regards.</p>

May 18, &mdash;&mdash;.<br />
</p>

<p>My Dear Dr. Flyingsquirrel:</p>

<p>Mother told me that you would appreciate a letter
from me; so, on this beautiful morning, I have
decided to write to you.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Miss Hare and we pupils were out
in the thicket and on the great moor east of Beaver
Creek. We were studying nature, by which to test
the books that we read.</p>

<p>My companion was Winkie Weasel. He has a
long, lean body, and a short, black tail. He is very
good-natured most of the time, but, occasionally, he
gets very angry over small things. Then his nose
seems to grow pointed, and his eyes turn green. He
wears a yellow coat now. Later he will change it
for a dark brown one, while in winter he wears
white. Although Winkie takes things that do not
belong to him and tries to act innocent, I like him
because he is so bright and shrewd.</p>

<p>Such a glorious day as it was! The birds were
chattering all about us, building nests in which to
rear their broods. Miss Hare said I was fortunate
to be able to climb so well, for it gave me such good
opportunities to inspect birds and their nests.</p>

<p>Once we were startled by a loud thump! thump!
thump! Then we heard a chorus of piping voices,
and saw a covey of partridges running through the
tall grass. They are peculiar little creatures, and
they never try to run until some one almost steps
upon them. They were out hunting for seeds, buds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and insects. Miss Hare told us that the partridge
wears bristles that serve as snowshoes in winter, so
it can walk on the soft snow without sinking.</p>

<p>We saw pigeons fluttering about in the blue sky,
while swallows, with graceful, slender wings, flitted
by, busily building their nests.</p>

<p>The sweet scent of spring had brought the cuckoos
to the north. I could see one of them flying
in a very straight line, his long tail steadying his
flight. I have always loved the voice of the cuckoo;
but I do not admire the bird, since Miss Hare has
told me how very unprincipled she is.</p>

<p>I should like to tell you about some of the other
birds I saw, but I fear you would think my letter
too long. Busy people like you do not like to waste
so much time reading letters.</p>

<p>Wishing you health and success, I am,</p>

<p class="marginright">
<span class="ir4">Yours very respectfully,</span><br />

</p>

<p>Dear Tiny:</p>

<p>Your letter filled my heart with delight. We old
squirrels appreciate letters from our young friends,
and we are glad to be remembered in our declining
years. The young who remember the old will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
rewarded when they themselves are no longer
young.</p>

<p>I, too, fly about a great deal, studying the various
birds and their eggs. You wrote about the
cuckoo, and I agree with you that she is a very unprincipled
creature.</p>

<p>She lays her eggs on the hard ground, because
she and her mate are too indolent to build a nest.
She places her eggs in various nests for other birds
to hatch. Usually she prefers robins’ nests, for
they are very comfortable. You can imagine how
surprised the robin or any other bird would be,
when its brood hatches, to find among the number a
large, healthy cuckoo with a wide mouth and an
enormous appetite. But the kind foster parents
feed the young cuckoo just as they do their own
children.</p>

<p>And what does the cuckoo orphan do to repay
such kindness? He eats and sleeps and grows larger
all the time; and, finally, one day when the old birds
are away, he tumbles his foster brothers and sisters
out of the nest, and stretches himself out comfortably,
waiting for his dinner. The selfish, cruel bird
never thinks of anyone but himself. When his
foster parents return, they are grieved not to find
their little ones, but they do not scold the cuckoo
at all. They keep on feeding him until he is full-fledged.
Then, on some bright day, he takes wings
and flies away, leaving his foster parents to grieve
after him.</p>

<p>Jenny Wren is a neat, modest little body. Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
know her? She wears a plain brown gown, for she
has so much to do she cannot dress very stylishly.
Her wings are hard and stiff, so she can beat the
air when she flies; but the feathers close to her tiny
body are soft and warm.</p>

<p>She likes to build her nest beneath the gnarled
roots of a tree or against a stone in a bed of moss.
It is covered with a little dome and has a tiny door,
which opens on the sunny side. I once peeped into
Jenny’s home and found it neat and cozy. An orderly
housekeeper she is, I can tell you! Her bed is
made of fine feathers, hair, and delicate grasses.
The roof of her home is made of moss, twigs, and
lichens.</p>

<p>We are all very well, and we hope that you will
call to see us soon after your return home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Reynard caught a cold just two weeks before
Miss Hare’s school closed for the summer. He was
very ill, indeed; but Tiny, Snowball, and his other
friends did all they
could to make him
comfortable.</p>

<div id="Ref_116" class="figleft" style="width: 350px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MISS HARE SPENT ONE EVENING WITH REYNARD.
PUSS SNOWBALL, WINKIE WEASEL
AND TINY WERE PRESENT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Miss Hare spent
one evening with
Reynard. Puss
Snowball, Winkie
Weasel, and Tiny
were present. They
had a pleasant time,
in Reynard’s humble
room, which the
stars made almost
bright as day.</p>

<p>“Shall I get you some corn?” Miss Hare finally
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t want no corn,” groaned Reynard, whose
head ached severely.</p>

<p>“Very well, I will bring you some,” said Miss
Hare, rising to leave the room.</p>

<p>“I don’t want no corn!” repeated Reynard, so
surprised that his head almost stopped aching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“That means that you <em>do</em> want some corn,”
laughed Miss Hare. “I suppose you meant to say
that you <em>don’t</em> want <em>any</em> corn, or that you want <em>no</em>
corn. Be careful what you say, Reynard, and
never use two denying words where the meaning
needs but one. The other day I heard you say, ‘I
haven’t seen <em>nothing</em>,’ which meant that you must
have seen <em>something</em>. You also said, ‘He is <em>not</em>
doing <em>nothing</em>,’ which meant that he was doing
<em>something</em>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Miss Hare,” said Reynard, with
chagrin. “I know that I am sometimes very careless
in the use of English. But now my head feels
so much better that perhaps, after all, <em>I don’t</em> need
<em>no</em> corn.”</p>

<p>Miss Hare laughed again, with more pleasure
this time, and gave him a few kernels of corn which
she had brought with her.</p>

<p>“Now we must do something to amuse Reynard,”
said Miss Hare, pleasantly. “What shall we do?”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear Snowball sing a song,”
said Reynard. “He sings good.”</p>

<p>“He does not sing <em>good</em>, but he sings <em>well</em>,” corrected
Miss Hare, in a low voice to Reynard. “Will
you sing, Snowball?”</p>

<p>“I can’t sing to-night,” said Snowball. “I, too,
have a bad cold.”</p>

<p>“You have a <em>severe</em> cold,” said Miss Hare. “It
is as wrong to say that you have a <em>bad</em> cold as it is
to say that you received a <em>good</em> whipping.”</p>

<p>Snowball was one of those individuals who do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
like to be corrected, so for a few moments he
shrugged his shoulders and pouted.</p>

<p>Miss Hare turned towards Tiny and said in a
cheerful voice:</p>

<p>“Perhaps Tiny will tell us about Squirreltown.”</p>

<p>“Good! good!” shouted enthusiastic Winkie
Weasel, leaping awkwardly into the air to show his
delight. “Tell us about the time you wandered
through the great forest and did not know where
you were at.”</p>

<p>“Fy, fy, Winkie!” cried his teacher, shaking
with laughter. “How you abuse such useful little
words as <em>at</em>, <em>to</em>, and <em>for</em>. You make them work
when they should be resting. You say that Tiny
did not know where he was <em>at</em>, nor where he was
going <em>to</em>, when you should say that Tiny did not
know where he was, nor where he was going. One
should not place <em>at</em>, <em>to</em>, <em>for</em>, or some other <em>unnecessary</em>
little word at the end of a sentence.”</p>

<p>Snowball was very glad to hear the teacher correct
Winkie, and soon he regained his usual good
humor.</p>

<p>“Winkie and I are both alike in our use of bad
English,” he chuckled.</p>

<p>“You are especially apt to use unnecessary
words, Snowball,” said Miss Hare. “Why should
you say ‘Winkie and I are <em>both</em> alike,’ when it takes
less time to say, ‘Winkie and I are alike’?”</p>

<p>Snowball stared stupidly for a while, but did not
seem vexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought to myself that Snowball was making
an incorrect statement,” tittered Winkie.</p>

<p>“Of course, you thought to yourself,” said the
teacher with a twinkle in her eye. “You certainly
could not think aloud.”</p>

<p>“No, but he knows how to laugh aloud,” said
Snowball, somewhat scornfully.</p>

<p>“Now, Tiny, you may tell us something about
Squirreltown,” said Miss Hare.</p>

<p>Tiny did not feel so brave about talking as he
did on the day he tried to address the mayor and
citizens of his native town, for he knew that his
present audience was a very critical one. However,
he began:</p>

<p>“A wide path leads into Squirreltown. At the
place where it enters the city it is very wide indeed.
An oak tree stands on both sides of this
path&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How strange!” interrupted Miss Hare. “Isn’t
it rather unusual for a tree to stand on both sides
of a path?”</p>

<p>“There are two trees,” stammered Tiny.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” said Miss Hare, a flash of understanding
shining in her eyes. “You mean to say
that on <em>each</em> side of the path there is an oak tree.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am,” replied Tiny, with a nod. “The
trees in the city do not contain many acorns, but
these two trees are filled full of them.”</p>

<p>“Of course, if they are <em>filled</em> with acorns, they
must be <em>full</em> of them,” laughed Miss Hare. “It
sounds as badly to say <em>filled full</em> as it does to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<em>little small</em>. Just how are the trees filled with
acorns, Tiny? Are the trunks hollow?”</p>

<p>“The branches of the two trees,” bravely continued
Tiny, “bear so many acorns that they could
yield all the squirrels in the land an acorn.”</p>

<p>“Then the branches can not bear very many
acorns,” said Miss Hare. “One acorn could not
very well be divided among such a host of squirrels.”</p>

<p>“I mean that these two trees could yield <em>each</em>
squirrel in the land an acorn,” said Tiny, with
energy.</p>

<p>“That is right,” said Miss Hare, much pleased.
“Tiny is one who thinks, and I believe that in time
he will learn to speak correctly.”</p>

<p>“I have lived in Squirreltown nearly all my life,
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How many squirrels live there?” interrupted
the teacher.</p>

<p>“Several hundred,” replied Tiny, proudly.</p>

<p>“Then it is not such a great city, after all. It
would be better to say that you lived <em>at</em> Squirreltown.
When it becomes a great city, you can say
that you lived <em>in</em> Squirreltown.”</p>

<p>“I lived on Oak Avenue&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It is better to say that you lived <em>in</em> Oak
Avenue,” suggested Miss Hare.</p>

<p>“One day a bear met my mother with crooked
teeth, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who had crooked teeth, the bear or your
mother?” tittered Snowball.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“The bear, to be sure,” retorted Tiny, growing
quite indignant.</p>

<p>“You should place your helping phrases where
they will give the right meaning,” said Miss Hare.
“There are many animals ready to make sport of
us if we are not careful to say just what we mean.”</p>

<p>“Really, I am so puzzled that I have forgotten
what I intended to say,” said Tiny, sitting down.
“I cannot say properly where I am, or where I live,
or anything else. All I know is that I am very
dull.”</p>

<p>“You are not dull,” declared Miss Hare. “When
an animal finds out that he has much to learn, it is
a good indication that he really knows something.
Only the ignorant are satisfied with their own imperfect
way of speaking. Now I will sing for you
a little lullaby that an otter formerly sang to her
little one every night:”</p>

<p>Hardly had Miss Hare finished singing the
lullaby, when Billy Beaver began thumping with
his tail to let all the students of Beaver Creek know
that it was time to retire.</p>

<p>“Goodnight, Reynard. I hope you will sleep
well,” said the teacher kindly. “Goodnight, Tiny
and Snowball and Winkie. I hope that my criticisms
will benefit you. Remember that I meant
them all in kindness. Is there anything I can do
for you, Reynard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, please,” said the fox, hoarsely. “Tell
Billy to bring me a cold pan of water.”</p>

<p>“Poor fox! Poor fox! I will tell him to bring
you a pan of <em>cold water</em>,” said Miss Hare, with a
hearty laugh that set her long ears to bobbing. “It
makes little difference whether or not the <em>pan</em> is
cold.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>On Saturday afternoon Tiny and Winkie Weasel
went out for a frolic in the forest beyond the river.
Reynard Redfox had almost recovered from his
severe cold, but he stayed at home, thinking of the
golden summer so near at hand with its red strawberries
and wild grapes.</p>

<p>Winkie came from a family of very bloodthirsty
and suspicious character, but Miss Hare’s teachings
had made him as gentle as Weenie Mouse.
Although Tiny had been taught to shun weasels, he
had become quite fond of Winkie, because he was
bright and active.</p>

<p>Side by side they made their way through the
deep forest. The birds sang merrily and the sun
shone brightly. Lady’s-slippers with lemon-colored
pouches and long slender leaves grew in the
damp, low grounds. Occasionally a rose-colored
one nodded its fairy head at them.</p>

<p>“Summer will come soon,” said Tiny, his voice
ringing with happiness.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Winkie, as he stopped to sniff at
a fallen log. “How glad I am that cold weather
has passed away!”</p>

<p>A turn in the path brought them to a clump of
hazel bushes, where a queer spectacle met their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
gaze. An animal covered with mud and moss was
trailing along towards the creek. A striped gopher,
a queer little animal with bloated cheeks and no
neck at all, was annoying the poor creature by
jumping upon its back.</p>

<div id="Ref_125" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="600" height="517" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A QUEER LITTLE ANIMAL WITH BLOATED CHEEKS AND
NO NECK AT ALL WAS TORMENTING THE POOR
CREATURE BY JUMPING UPON ITS BACK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“It is a turtle,” said Tiny, who had seen creatures
of its kind before. “It has just awakened
from its winter slumber. You know that a turtle
settles down in the mud as soon as the frost kills
the insects, and there it stays until warm weather
comes again.”</p>

<p>“Stop teasing that turtle!” cried Winkie to the
gopher. “If you do not cease, you shall feel the
points of my teeth. Come here.”</p>

<p>The gopher jumped from the turtle’s back, and,
holding his head to one side, said good-naturedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am tired of teasing the slothful turtle, but
I am not too tired to run a race with you. Let us
see which of us three will beat in a race.”</p>

<p>Winkie readily consented; but, just as they had
drawn up in line to take a dash down the narrow
pathway, a deep growl resounded through the
thicket. Quick as a flash Winkie darted into a
hollow stump.</p>

<div id="Ref_126" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="600" height="553" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“FOLLOW ME,” SAID THE GOPHER, AS HE DISAPPEARED
INTO A HOLE IN THE GROUND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Follow me,” said the gopher, quite self-possessed,
as he disappeared into a hole in the
ground. Tiny did not like the idea of being under
ground, nor was he fond of animals that burrow;
but he obeyed, for he was frightened. He trembled
violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>They entered a dark hall, at the end of which was
a little, round room containing a comfortable bed
of soft grasses and fur.</p>

<p>“This is a cozy place,” said Tiny, sinking down
to rest.</p>

<p>“It is my home,” said the little animal. “I suppose
you know that I am Jolly Gopher. It is fortunate
that you happened to be so near my residence
when the panther happened along. Panthers are
rare in this temperate zone, and I am glad of it.
What if the savage beast had attacked me while I
was riding? I am glad that you like my humble
home.”</p>

<p>“It is a restful place for lazy animals, but I
should not like to dwell here,” said Tiny, frankly.
“I always distrusted creatures that burrow in the
ground away from the air and sunshine, until I
went to Miss Hare’s school.”</p>

<p>“What has Miss Hare’s school to do with it?”
asked the gopher, his mouth open.</p>

<p>“I learned that Mother Earth,” said Tiny, “is
kind indeed to poor little defenseless animals,
whom she protects from savage animals and
hunters. Animals all live where they can have the
greatest safety. The fish lives in the depths of the
water, the squirrel in the tree, the cricket under a
rock, and the gopher in the ground. How fortunate
it is that we do not all live in the same place!”</p>

<p>“I am fond of living down in the ground,” resumed
the gopher after a moment of silence. “No
panther nor any other beast bigger than myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
can meddle with my affairs. I saunter forth early
in the morning and fill my pockets with fresh, green
things. You see that my pockets hang down from
my cheeks. I hurry back and stow away my food.
When it rains, I stay indoors and sleep and eat.
A gopher’s life is a very peaceful one.”</p>

<p>“I wish I might have pockets,” said Tiny, wistfully.
“We squirrels don’t
have them, you know. I
believe I am the only squirrel
that carries a hunting
bag. It was made for me
by a tailor bird. She is a
rare and curious bird who
makes a nest that looks like
a bag. She selects tough
leaves and sews them together
with long, firm
strips of growing plants.
She uses her bill as a
needle.”</p>

<p>“How remarkable!” exclaimed
the gopher. “I think it would be nicer to
carry a hunting bag than to have pockets in my
cheeks. Sometimes my pockets are so full I can’t
get inside my house.”</p>

<p>“The bee also has pockets&mdash;six little pockets,”
said Tiny, reflectively.</p>

<p>“And the opossum and several other animals
have pockets in which they carry their children,”
added the gopher wisely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“You seem to observe things as much as I do,”
said Tiny, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I travel a great deal and have seen many
queer things,” replied the gopher, proudly.</p>

<div id="Ref_128" class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="250" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">SHE IS ABOUT THE ONLY ANIMAL
THAT DOES NOT FEAR THE STING
OF A BEE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Once I burrowed down into a badger’s home,” he
went on. “I saw the nursery with the little badgers
playing about in their bed of moss and grass. The
mother badger was very civil to me. She is about
the only animal that does not fear the sting of a bee,
because her skin is so tough and her hair is so thick.
It seems to me that of all animals, the badger is
treated with the greatest cruelty. When the hunters
catch her, they permit their dogs to torture her
to death. The harder the poor creature fights to get
away, the worse they abuse her, and the greater it
pleases the cruel hunters. Sometimes the poor animal
endures this brutal treatment for a full day.”</p>

<p>“I have often heard that the verb <em>to badger</em>
means <em>to tease</em>, or <em>to torment</em>,” said Tiny.</p>

<p>“I do not know anything about verbs,” replied
the gopher, “but I do know that some hunters are
very cruel.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a mole’s nest?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, when I was quite small, I had the privilege
of visiting one,” replied the gopher enthusiastically.
“You may think that the mole is a very
stupid animal, but I assure you that he is not.”</p>

<p>“An animal that lives in the dirt all the time
couldn’t be very intelligent,” interrupted Tiny.
“Besides, his eyes and ears are so small, he surely
cannot see and hear well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Little eyes and ears are often more keen than
larger ones,” quickly replied Jolly Gopher. “Do
you suppose that a giraffe can see or hear better
than you can? It is fortunate that the mole has
such tiny eyes and ears, otherwise they would catch
a great deal of dirt, as the little animal burrows
through the earth. The mole is very clean in appearance.
He sleeps three hours and then he works
three hours as long as he lives. He is a great
builder; he sinks wells to quench his thirst; he can
run fast; he can swim; and he can fight. He loves
his home in the ground. He seldom comes out.”</p>

<p>“Does he have a nice bed like yours?” asked
Tiny, much interested.</p>

<p>“Indeed, he has,” said the gopher. “His home
is one of the most wonderful things I have ever
seen. It is reached by passing through one of
several long, straight halls. The walls are so solid
that the rain seldom leaks through. I went into
one of these halls, and with some difficulty made my
way into another one, which was circular. From
this hall five passages led to another hall above my
head. I stopped at the foot of the nearest passage
to rest. Then I went up. The upper hall was
circular, but not so large as the lower one. I knew
that I was at the summit of the mole hill, for I
could plainly hear the birds singing overhead.
From this upper circular hall three more passages
led down to the main room. I went down into this
room and sat very quietly there for a few moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I wondered why the mole had made it so difficult
to get into his house.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he wants to make his house as safe
as possible,” suggested the squirrel.</p>

<p>“Precisely so,” said the gopher. “If he and his
family hear some vicious animal coming through
one of the long halls, they have a chance to escape.
The central room is a kind of fortress where they
seek protection.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see any of the little moles?” asked
Tiny, excitedly.</p>

<p>“No. I learned afterwards that their nursery
was built at a point where two or more of the long
halls cross one another. It was situated in an out
of the way place with many avenues of escape.
Their bed was made of blades of grass and other
soft material. I am sure that the nest of a mole is
safer than that of a goldfinch hanging high up in
a tree. Why does the goldfinch usually build her
nest at the end of a branch?”</p>

<p>“Because she likes to have her nest dance up and
down and sway about in the breeze,” said Tiny.
“The goldfinch builds very well. Her nest is made
of lichens and moss and sheep’s wool, and is so
fashioned that the little birds cannot roll out.
What jolly times the goldfinches must have teetering
up and down in a roomy nest on a starlit
night!”</p>

<p>“Yet they surely suffer when it storms, while the
little moles are never bothered by lightning and
thunder,” quickly interposed the gopher. “I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it is fortunate that all animals do not have
the same ideas about things.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear something about prairie
dogs,” said Tiny, after a while.</p>

<p>“I will gladly tell you,” returned the gopher,
settling himself more comfortably. “Sometimes
hundreds of prairie dogs live together in one city.
It is interesting to watch the round towers of their
dwellings. Most prairie dogs have small brown
eyes and grayish-red fur. Although they are agile
little animals, they do not work much. You would
laugh to see them when they bark, for they shake
their stumpy tails and jerk to and fro. They yelp
like dogs. Some of them act as guards and sit out
upon their roofs all day long, looking about the
horizon. When an enemy approaches, they bark
loudly and rush into their houses, and all the chattering
ceases. For a while the city is as quiet as
night; but, in a few minutes, many inquisitive,
dark eyes peep out to see if danger still threatens
them.”</p>

<p>“Their city must be a very lively place,” observed
Tiny.</p>

<p>“Many other animals visit there,” said the
gopher. “All kinds of vicious creatures flock to a
great city, you know. The prairie dogs are often
molested by hawks, burrowing owls, and coyotes.
I believe I prefer to live in the country.”</p>

<p>“I am quite satisfied with my mode of living, as
we all should be,” said Tiny. “I have been greatly
benefited by learning about these animals. If one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
should get blue or homesick or discouraged, it
would pay him to visit a gopher and find out how
other less fortunate animals live. Then he would
return home quite contented with his lot. I thank
you for teaching me so much.”</p>

<p>“You are welcome,” replied the gopher. “I, too,
have learned from you, so we have been mutually
helped. I never knew before that it is wrong to
engage in any kind of sport that gives pain to
another. Henceforth I will never tease a turtle or
take a ride on his back.”</p>

<p>“I must go,” declared Tiny, rising from his
downy couch.</p>

<p>“Stay longer,” pleaded the gopher. “The moon
rises early, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is no reason why I should go to bed late,”
interrupted Tiny. “My teacher may worry about
me. Goodby, Mr. Gopher.”</p>

<p>“Goodby. You must come back,” replied the
gopher sleepily.</p>

<p>Before Tiny could reach the door, his acquaintance
with the pockets in his cheeks was fast asleep.</p>

<p>The little red squirrel’s heart beat with joy and
thankfulness when the dewy air, laden with the
sweet fragrance of early summer, again greeted
his nostrils. With nimble leaps he made his way
through the leaf-strewn pathway to the edge of
the crystal stream. Before him lay the quaint
beaver houses that had become so dear to him, while
beyond, the pink western skies faded softly into
gray, like the happy days of his youth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>About two weeks before the close of school, Miss
Hare met with a misfortune. Because of the great
amount of work she had to do, grading examination
papers, her eyes became so weak that she scarcely
could use them. Tiny felt sorry for the patient,
hard-working teacher, and offered to be of assistance
to her.</p>

<p>“You may come into the schoolroom and help
me,” she said to him one Saturday morning. “I
have a number of important letters to write. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
are very painstaking, and I shall be glad to have
your assistance.”</p>

<p>Tiny followed her into the room and sat down
beside the desk, very happy to be of some use to
one he so thoroughly respected. The material upon
which he wrote was not so white and smooth as the
paper used in schoolrooms nowadays. It was
simply birch bark that could be rolled up and tied
with heavy grass. The ink he used was the juice of
the pokeberry, and his pen was a goose quill.</p>

</div>

<p>As soon as he had written a letter, he rolled it
neatly, addressed it carefully, and gave it to Billy
Beaver, who called a carrier pigeon to take it to its
place of destination.</p>

<p>During the hour that Tiny spent in the schoolroom
that morning, he learned about money orders
and drafts, for it is said that at one time the more
enlightened residents of Animal Kingdom made
use of them.</p>

<p>“This has been a very pleasant task, I assure
you,” said Tiny, when his work was done. “I have
learned how to write a business letter, which is an
important thing to know. I never before had heard
of money orders and drafts. You know we do not
have those things, nor money, nor stores, at
Squirreltown.”</p>

<p>“Only a few of the more intelligent animals
know anything about business,” replied Miss Hare.
“I know of only two large department stores and
three banks in Animal Kingdom. I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that the ancient human beings used shells for
money; but, finally, they established the use of
coins, because they were valued by all classes of
people. If the hunters would not molest us, Animal
Kingdom would imitate the human race and
become very much enlightened. Some day I hope
you may visit the department store of Sheep, Goat
&amp; Co., and see for yourself how animals are advancing
in knowledge. I understand that this great
store employs almost a dozen clerks.”</p>

<p>“I have also learned how to write an invitation
and notes of regret and acceptance. They seem to
be very simple in their construction,” said Tiny,
placing the quill in a shell filled with sand.</p>

<p>“No self-respecting animal should neglect his
correspondence, no matter how busy he may be,”
said Miss Hare. “As a rule, one who hates to write
letters is one who cannot write them well. It is
necessary that one should write social and business
letters, and learn how to make them clear and
forceful. Now you may rest. I thank you for your
services, Tiny.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>Tiny’s last ramble through the copse near
Beaver Creek was one that he never forgot. He
was beginning to realize how much more pleasing
are the works of Nature when one really takes an
interest in them. He had learned to study even
the snail in his shell house and the Venus’ fly-trap
that catches insects.</p>

<p>“Aren’t the skies blue, and the trees and grasses
green, and the music of the birds sweet, and the
busy hum of the insects inspiring?” he asked himself
again and again.</p>

<p>Once he stopped to admire the graceful foliage
of the alder tree.</p>

<p>“That tree has some secrets hidden away that
I mean to find out,” said he, as he scurried
up its smooth trunk. He gazed through the
branches. At last he espied a nest. It was built
of coarse sticks.</p>

<p>“What an odd place for a jay bird’s home!” he
exclaimed. “I never could understand why the jay
does not build a comfortable nest like that of the
robin. Perhaps he fears he might spoil his little
ones by making them too comfortable.”</p>

<p>Next he saw a queer object that held his attention
for a long time. A caterpillar was hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from a leaf. Tiny thought that it was about to
fall, but the little worm held fast with all its might.
It was attaching a fine thread to the point of a leaf,
but it worked harder than the man who fells a tree.</p>

<p>“Do not molest that caterpillar,” said a voice
from a limb overhead.</p>

<p>Tiny looked up and saw a peculiar animal with
a long, pointed face and sharp teeth, hanging head
downward from a limb overhead. With a startled
cry, the squirrel hid in a thick branch.</p>

<p>“You need not fear me, for I do not eat squirrels,”
said the odd creature. “I am looking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
birds. I should think you would be ashamed to
attack a poor little caterpillar.”</p>

<p>“Never in my life have I molested a caterpillar,”
declared Tiny. “I should think you would be
ashamed to attack birds.”</p>

<p>“Well, everything depends upon the point of
view,” replied the larger animal. “I am not responsible
if my views do not agree with your own,
for I see things upside down.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">“WHY DO YOU HANG BY YOUR TAIL?” TINY ASKED.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Why do you hang by your tail?” asked Tiny.
From his hiding place he peeped at the curious
animal.</p>

<p>“Because I am an opossum, and I am wise
enough to know that tails were made to hang by.
I couldn’t hang by my neck, could I?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” replied Tiny, with a laugh.
“Reynard, Snowball, and Rover have strong tails.
I will tell them that they should cultivate the use
of them, as the opossum does.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to teach them how,” said the opossum,
not in the least offended at the squirrel’s
amusement. Tiny drew closer to get a better view
of his new acquaintance. He could look into his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Reynard, Snowball, or Rover is going with me
to-morrow. I should like you to teach some of
your amusing tricks to the one who comes.”</p>

<p>The opossum laughed so hard that Tiny feared
he would lose his hold and fall upon him.</p>

<p>“Neither Reynard, Rover, nor Snowball is likely
to be benefited by anything that I may teach him,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
said the opossum, evidently much pleased by Tiny’s
suggestion. “Neither the birds nor the animals
admire me.”</p>

<p>“I do not dislike you,” said Tiny, truthfully.</p>

<p>“I am not so dull as one might think. I can sit
up and I can hang by my tail.”</p>

<p>“I can sit up, but I cannot hang by my tail,” said
Tiny. “Some squirrels can fly, but I am sure I can
beat any flying squirrel in a race. A red, a gray,
and a black squirrel live close together at Squirreltown.
The mayor sends them with messages to
other neighboring towns. They are as swift as
lightning.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you wonder why I am looking so
closely at that caterpillar,” said the opossum,
without stopping to argue concerning the fleetness
of squirrels. “All morning long I have watched
with anxious eyes.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you want to see what he is trying to
do,” suggested Tiny.</p>

<p>“The caterpillar does not interest me at all,”
said the opossum rather brusquely. “I am waiting
for a bird to come along to catch the caterpillar.
Before the bird catches the worm, I shall catch the
bird&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And perhaps some hunter will catch you before
you can catch the bird,” interrupted Tiny.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said the opossum. “Every animal
always seems to be ready to catch another one.
I like pretty birds as you like plump acorns. A
yellow, brown, and blue bird is a very attractive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
creature. An ugly sparrow is not half so pleasing
to me as a golden oriole.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that you like to destroy birds,” said
Tiny, who had learned to love the little feathered
songsters of the forest. “You are cowardly. You
attack birds. They are smaller than you.”</p>

<p>“I am cowardly but cautious,” returned the
opossum. “I should be foolish to try to capture
an eagle. I have caught six little birds this morning.
The first, second, and third birds were sparrows.
The fourth, the fifth, and the sixth birds
were robins.”</p>

<p>“The poor things surely did not suffer long.
Your mouth is so large and your teeth are so
sharp,” said the red squirrel.</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” inquired the opossum,
still gazing at the caterpillar.</p>

<p>“I came from Beaver Creek,” answered Tiny.
“I am out to-day to study Nature.”</p>

<p>“Then you needn’t spend any more of your time
here. There are other things to see,” snapped the
opossum. “Your incessant chatter is keeping the
birds away.”</p>

<p>“Where do you live?” asked Tiny, wishing to
save as many birds as possible.</p>

<p>“Close by,” replied the opossum indifferently.
“I live in a dead tree.”</p>

<p>“What has become of the caterpillar?”</p>

<p>“It is still working away. It is a remarkable
toiler. Now it has succeeded in bending back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
point of the leaf and has fastened it down with bits
of thread.”</p>

<p>“It has curled the leaf until it looks like a little
tube with a very round hole at each end,” said
Tiny, much interested.</p>

<p>“Caterpillars make houses of leaves,” explained
the opossum.</p>

<p>“How very odd!” exclaimed the squirrel.</p>

<p>“That depends upon the point of view,” repeated
the opossum. “Insects breathe through
holes along their sides. You have lungs. Through
these lungs you breathe. Both of these methods of
breathing might seem very odd to the fish, who
breathes through his gills.”</p>

<p>“How can the caterpillar turn around in such a
small house?” asked Tiny.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t wish to turn around,” said the opossum.
“The caterpillar does not wiggle so much as
the squirrel. It knows that big houses are seldom
half as cozy as smaller ones. As soon as it gets
settled down to housekeeping, it begins to eat its
little green house.”</p>

<p>“How funny!” chuckled Tiny.</p>

<p>“Before very long it eats itself out of house and
home,” said the opossum.</p>

<p>“What would you do if a hunter were to steal
up and club you?” asked Tiny, more interested in
the quadruped than in the worm.</p>

<p>“If a hunter should attack me, I would drop
down and play that I was dead,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Once Snowball pretended to be asleep when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Billy Beaver called him,” said Tiny. “Billy said
that Snowball was ‘playing ’possum.’ Now I know
what he meant.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that the opossum is not the only animal
that tries to deceive,” said the opossum, with
a yawn.</p>

<p>“I see that you are sleepy,” said the squirrel.
“I must go to my home. I wonder why animals
are so impolite as to yawn when they are entertaining
company.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better for you to say
goodby before your entertainers tire of you,” retorted
the opossum.</p>

<p>This advice was a golden gift to Tiny. He never
forgot it. With a courteous farewell, he hastened
down the trunk of the tree. When he reached the
ground, he stopped a moment to gaze overhead.
The opossum was asleep among the branches.</p>

<p>“He had better be sleeping than killing birds,”
said Tiny, gratefully. “I shall visit the opossum
often and keep him out of mischief. This afternoon
has been well spent. I have stood between the
birds and their enemy.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>The last day of school rolled round. The pupils
of the Beaver Creek School were in a state of pleasant
excitement. They smoothed their feathers or
brushed their fur until they were as sleek as could
be. All the civilized animals for miles around were
present. Mr. Owl, looking wiser and more serious
than ever, was the first visitor to arrive. Miss
Hare, with earrings hanging from her long ears
and a wreath of white blossoms on her head,
greeted him warmly. Soon after, Mother Goose,
the most beloved fowl in Animal Kingdom, waddled
into the main building in good time. Sammy Rabbit’s
relatives followed her, also Puss Snowball’s
mother and aunt.</p>

<p>Billy Beaver and his friends had erected a platform
in the creek, and upon its smooth surface had
built a green bower. The messenger pigeons had
adorned this bower with beautiful flowers, and the
pupils had filled in the rough places of the floor
with pretty shells and pebbles.</p>

<p>On the shady bank across the way, the larger
animals of the wood had gathered. Tiny could see
them plainly as he sat in his room, brushing out
his long tail. There were Mr. Goat, of the great
department store, and his daughter, Miss Nannie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the Otter family in their best garments; Miss Mink,
a close friend of Miss Hare; several from the
Badger family; and, in the background, as modest
as could be, Mr. Opossum, Jolly Gopher, and the
Ferret brothers.</p>

<p>While awaiting the signal of Billy Beaver, Tiny
was visited by Shifty Woodchuck, who carried a
soiled composition.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please help me?” whined Shifty, as
he thrust the composition between Tiny’s forepaws.
“You know I was to graduate with your class, but
Miss Hare will not let me.”</p>

<div id="Ref_148" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="600" height="385" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“WON’T YOU PLEASE HELP ME?” WHINED SHIFTY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Pupils that fail should not blame their teachers.
It is entirely your own fault,” said Tiny, looking
over the careless manuscript.</p>

<p>“I wish I hadn’t slept so much last winter,” continued
Shifty, ruefully. “However, I believe that
if Miss Hare will let me read my composition, I
will get the prize. Miss Hare says I cannot read
it properly, because it is carelessly written. Please
tell me what is the matter with it. To me it looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
very well. I have spent nearly an hour in writing
it.”</p>

<p>“If you ever intend to write a good composition,
you will have to work longer than an hour,” said
Tiny. “You will have to read things that will help
you, and you must exercise great care. Moreover,
you must not postpone your work until the last
minute.”</p>

<p>Tiny, with great difficulty, read Shifty’s composition,
which was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">one saturday Afternoon in may</p>

<p>“the first may Holiday was beautiful! the sun
shined bright. birds twittered and sung sweetly the
flowers were in bloom. nature was happy. warm
weather had came. mister beaver and me went
for a stroll. how our hearts thrilled with Joy?
We stopped by the Creek. us animals like the
water</p>

<p>the clear sparkling waves passed by us. hark
sweet music comes from the brook and the forest
they cried.</p>

<p>come into the woods mister beaver i said, are
you afraid of the tall trees.</p>

<p>i will set here says he. a Beaver don’t wander
into the Thicket, he prefers the Creek. daisys and
violets may be pretty but spatter-docks is prettier,
you can go if you wish, and I will stay here.</p>

<p>i replied that Woodchucks squirrels rabbits and
many other animals preferred the wild flowers. i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ran to the bushes. o how cool they seemed. they
were green and fragrant with blossoms, the leaves
of the trees were bigger than their’s but they wasn’t
more beautiful. i wandered for a hour through the
woods. i seen a birds’ nest and many interesting
things, a active guinea hen was hiding among the
Ferns with her brood</p>

<p>a few deers were laying behind a pile of brush,
they run when i approached. i could heer wild
geeses’ cries. every animal of the forest were moving
about. in each glade was a hundred live creatures.
i went back to the brook, mister beaver was
waiting for me.</p>

<p>“did you have a pleasant time he asked lazily?”</p>

<p>the forest is grand i cried joyously. the animals
of the forest are rejoicing while you are setting by
this brook with a long face.</p></blockquote>

<p>“What is wrong with it?” inquired Shifty, when
the red squirrel had finished reading. “I am sure
that it is as well written as the others, for I am a
good speller and have learned not to use bad
grammar.”</p>

<p>“Everything is wrong with it,” said Tiny,
frankly, although he was too polite to make fun
of Shifty’s ignorance.</p>

<p>At that moment Billy Beaver began thumping
with his long tail.</p>

<p>“Read it over very carefully many times, and
perhaps you may be able to find your mistakes,”
said Tiny, as he hastened out into the sunlit air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>From the top of the bower over the platform a
chorus of goldfinches, swallows, robins, and wrens
began singing “Hail to Spring.” At the same
time Miss Hare, followed by the graduating class,
came out of the schoolroom, and, with great dignity,
made her way to the platform. Miss Hare
seated herself upon a mossy cushion, while the
graduating class sat near her, forming a semicircle.
The graduates were Susie Goose, Sammy
Rabbit, Winkie Weasel, Puss Snowball, Rover
Canine, Reynard Redfox, and Tiny Redsquirrel.</p>

<p>At the close of the song, which
was followed by loud cries of applause,
Mr. Owl, who sat upon a
branch in front of the platform,
said that the class would proceed
to deliver their compositions. He
added that a prize would be given
to the one who had the best theme,
and that Miss Hare, Mother Goose,
and he would be judges.</p>

<p>When this announcement was
made, Mother Goose rose from her
comfortable seat by the side of the
Misses Pea Fowl and Guinea, and
flew to a seat beside Mr. Owl. The audience cheered
again more loudly than before.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">SAMMY RABBIT WAS
THE FIRST OF
THE CLASS TO
SPEAK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sammy Rabbit was the first of the class to speak.
Leaping to the front of the platform, he faced his
audience, and, with a profound bow, read as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">SOME QUEER CREATURES I HAVE SEEN.</p>

<p>One day our teacher sent us out to study Nature.
She said that we should observe the simplest things,
for often they were the most instructive.</p>

<p>My friend, Puss Snowball, went with me. Both
of us were anxious to improve our time. We animals
are fast friends.</p>

<p>Three merry little ferrets darted across our
pathway. We followed them, but finally gave up
the chase. Snowball’s fur was filled with briers
and thistles; I was covered with mud, and had to
bathe in the brook. How we laughed! At last we
decided that we would study the smallest and
simplest things, as our teacher had told us to do.</p>

<p>We found some earthworms in the soft loam.
These little creatures burrow into the soil when
the first frost comes. They spend the winter deep
in the ground, where the cold cannot reach them.
They do not mind if it blows and snows.</p>

<p>We saw a katydid. He was of a pale green
color. His gauzy wings had little covers that
looked like drums. He rubbed the drums briskly,
and the music that he made was very cheerful. Did
you ever hear the katydid’s shrilling? The katydid,
however, is very small.</p>

<p>We saw two interesting spiders in the brook.
Spiders have eight legs, while true insects have
only six. One of these little creatures had made a
silken diving-bell that resembled a tiny silver globe.
The other had made a raft of weeds, fastened together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with silken threads. Then they went slowly
downstream to catch insects that might fall into
the water. Spiders, although quite tiny, are very
clever. When spiders sleep, they sleep soundly;
when they work, they work industriously; when
they fight, they fight fiercely.</p>

<p>Ants, bees, and wasps are interesting. The fly,
too, is worthy of study. It has four thousand small
eyes. Observe it carefully.</p>

<p>Nature is full of wonderful, beautiful things&mdash;but
I shall not have time to tell any more about
the queer creatures I have seen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sammy’s composition was much appreciated.
He had chosen a simple, familiar subject and kept
it plainly in mind.</p>

<p>Winkie Weasel met with less favor, for he had
undertaken to write about something that was beyond
his understanding. One can imagine how
much a little weasel would know about “The
Growth of Intellectual Perspicuity.” He stumbled
over the long words in a way that made all the little
prairie dogs in the front row titter in a very impolite
manner. Weenie Mouse became so much
frightened that he scampered away, long before
it was time for him to recite, and caused quite a
panic amongst the members of the Hen family.</p>

<p>The other compositions were well written, although
Puss Snowball’s was spoiled by a singsong
delivery.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the frog orchestra, from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
green lily pads close by, would play a spirited air;
and Jenny Wren, a nervous little body, who
twitched every time she reached a high note, sang
“Happy Woodlands.”</p>

<div id="Ref_155" class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i_155.jpg" width="459" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">TINY REDSQUIRREL WAS THE LAST OF HIS
CLASS TO APPEAR BEFORE THE AUDIENCE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Tiny Redsquirrel was the last of his class to appear
before the audience. With becoming modesty,
he rose, saluted the judges and his hearers, and
recited in a loud, clear voice:</p>

<p class="center p1 poemheader">HAPPINESS EVERYWHERE.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">There is a spell in every flower,
</div><div class="indent1">A sweetness in each spray;
</div><div class="indent0">And every single bird has power
</div><div class="indent1">To please us with its lay.
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">And there is music on the breeze
</div><div class="indent1">That sports along the glade;
</div><div class="indent0">The crystal dewdrops on the trees
</div><div class="indent1">Are gems by fancy made.
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indent0">Oh, there is joy and happiness
</div><div class="indent1">In everything we see!
</div><div class="indent0">But greatest joys we shall possess
</div><div class="indent1">Through truth and purity.
</div></div></div></div>

<p>When he had finished, all the animals near and
far gave vent to tremendous applause, for animal
audiences are not so hard to please as those composed
of human beings. Mr. Opossum became so
enthusiastic that he shouted at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Mr. Redsquirrel! One cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
judge by the size of a creature how much he can
say.”</p>

<p>Miss Hare joined the other two judges, and for
a few moments they held an earnest conversation
among themselves, while the audience sat in breathless
expectation.</p>

<p>Finally, Mother Goose descended from her perch
and waddled to the front of the platform, where
she faced the eager listeners and said in a shrill,
but kindly voice:</p>

<p>“Animals of the forest, the judges have decided
that the prize should go to Mr. Tiny Redsquirrel of
Squirreltown!”</p>

<p>Turning to the embarrassed but happy little
squirrel, she pulled from her wing a quill, which
she gave him with a low bow, saying:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/i_157.jpg" width="425" height="237" alt="This quill was taken from my wing." />
</div>

<p>“This quill was taken from my wing. No creature
is more respected by the human race and all
other animals than I am. Anyone who receives a
quill pen made from one of my feathers will be
famous ever after. Accept this reward for your
excellent poem and your good scholarship; but bear
in mind that
every achievement
is but a
camping place
for the night.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>Tiny never forgot the pleasant half hour that
followed his graduation. Although he felt happy,
he was sorry to leave dear old Beaver Creek with
its many delightful associations. After waving a
friendly farewell to Mr. Opossum, Jolly Gopher,
and his other chance acquaintances, he turned to
bid his classmates goodby. The bird choir was still
singing its sweetest airs.</p>

<p>“Your poem was very good for a beginner,” said
Miss Hare, with a smile. “I suspect that you spent
much time in its preparation.”</p>

<p>“I expect to write a better one in a year from
now,” replied Tiny.</p>

<p>“You did not get frightened at all,” said timid
Katie Goose, who had been unable to read her composition
loud enough for her audience to hear.</p>

<p>“One is never afraid of an audience unless he is
afraid of himself,” said Tiny. “I hope your
future life will be happy, Katie.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied Katie. “I want to be a
lovely character like my aunt, dear old Mother
Goose.”</p>

<p>“I want to thank you for your kindness to me,
Mr. Owl,” continued the squirrel, running to where
the wise trustee of the school sat listening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
merry chorus of voices. “I have done nothing to
pay for my board and tuition. In fact, I never
knew there was such a thing as money, and that
animals should pay for what they get from others,
instead of trying to steal it.”</p>

<p>“Do not worry about that,” said the owl, kindly.
“Miss Hare’s school is free to pupils that cannot
pay. It is kept up by taxes paid by the good citizens
of Joy County. In this day of free schools, it
is a terrible crime for animals to neglect their
education.”</p>

<p>“I shall organize a school in Squirreltown as
soon as I return,” said Tiny. “The little ones
would be more benefitted if they would exercise
their brains as well as their legs.”</p>

<p>“I wish you success,” said the owl prophet,
kindly. “Your education has just begun. Even if
you should live as many years as a turtle does, you
would never learn all there is to know. Most squirrels
observe closely, but almost every squirrel does
not think as much as he should.”</p>

<p>“I am going now,” said Tiny. “Please also accept
my thanks for your kindness to my mother
during my absence from home. I hope you will
come to Squirreltown and give me a chance to entertain
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied the owl. “I should be
glad to carry you home, but I believe you are old
enough to find your own way. There are many
other lessons for you to learn, and there are other
dreadful battles that you must fight alone. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
be brave and hopeful, no matter what befalls you.”</p>

<p>Tiny bade Miss Hare goodby, and she wished
him success. He tried to find Billy Beaver, but the
good janitor had already started up creek to his
work. One by one the graduates left the school
for their various homes, and, when Tiny started
forth on his journey, Beaver Creek was quiet and
deserted. With a sigh of regret he gazed back at
the domes of the buildings, and in his heart wished
that he might return.</p>

<p>As he turned into the narrow path that led to
the north, he heard the noise of pattering feet. In
a few moments Winkie Weasel was beside him,
panting heavily.</p>

<p>“I am going with you as far as Deertown,” said
he. “What a pleasant visit we shall have on the
way! You were always kind to help me with my
lessons, and I thank you.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are anxious to get back home,”
said Tiny, as they hurried along.</p>

<p>“Not very,” replied Winkie, seriously. “My
home is not pleasant. However, I am going to try
to exert a good influence over those with whom I
live. Weasels fight most of the time, you know. I
shall try to teach them that vegetables are as wholesome
as meat, and that weasels would be just as
healthy if they did not eat every little animal that
crossed their path.”</p>

<p>For a long time they chatted concerning their
classmates and the graduating exercises. They
praised their teacher’s elegant manners, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Goose’s excellent morals and grand air, the pretty
faces of the Otter sisters, the beautiful bower that
Billy Beaver and his friends had made, and the
neat schoolroom. Winkie congratulated Tiny
again and again upon his splendid victory.</p>

<p>When it grew dark, they stopped to rest. Tiny,
with the quill Mother Goose had given him securely
tied to his body, carefully climbed a tree. He found
a cozy spot sheltered by broad leaves. In the meantime,
Winkie found comfortable quarters in a
hollow log. Soon they fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night an awful storm arose.
The lightning flashed and the thunder roared. The
trees bent and swayed in the angry winds. It
seemed to Tiny that the world was coming to an
end; but he was brave and hopeful, for he knew
that the sunshine would be bright on the morrow.</p>

<p>When the storm had abated somewhat, he fell
asleep again. However, he slept badly. He thought
some cruel animal was about to spring upon him
and swallow him in one gulp. He was a really
brave little creature, but such dreams are prone to
disturb even the boldest animal.</p>

<p>He shuddered and opened his eyes with a start.
Not six feet away two terrible eyes of fire were fixed
upon him. He then knew that his dream was real.
In the flash of lightning that followed, he could
see a large animal about to spring at him. Its legs
were powerful, its feet were heavy, and its claws
glistened. Another flash of lightning revealed the
pointed ears of the terrible beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Tiny tried to escape, but the branch of the tree
was slippery with rain. In a twinkling he received
a terrific blow from an enormous paw. Then followed
a crash of thunder, an angry roar, and the
frightened shriek of a poor helpless squirrel.</p>

<p>“Oh, save me from the lynx&mdash;the lynx!” he cried.</p>

<p>Both he and the bloodthirsty creature had fallen
to the ground. Tiny knew that in another moment
he might meet with a tragic fate. Another flash
of lightning showed the lynx, with his fur standing
straight and his back curled, ready to pounce upon
him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHEN THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AGAIN HE DASHED FORWARD AND
THRUST THE PEN INTO THE DELICATE NOSTRILS OF THE LYNX.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Darkness came again. Tiny was so badly stunned
for a while that he could hardly move. He stood
dumbly awaiting the final blow. Then a loud roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of pain resounded through the forest. It was evident
to Tiny that some creature was attacking the
lynx. The little squirrel unloosened the pen that
had been given him. When the lightning flashed
again, he dashed forward and thrust it into the
delicate nostril of the lynx. There was another
cry, more of surprise than of pain, and the ferocious
animal disappeared in the blackness of night.</p>

<p>“We are safe now,” said Winkie Weasel’s welcome
voice. “It is fortunate that I came with you.
Just as the lynx was about to destroy you, I rushed
out of the stump and gave his tail a bite that he
will not soon forget. I think, judging by the way
he yelled, he must have thought he was struck by
lightning.”</p>

<p>Tiny was too weak to reply. He stood shivering
in the rain, yet he was grateful that he had learned
the value of friendship. Winkie, who enjoyed
dreadful encounters, pushed him back into the
stump that he might protect him through the night.
There they remained until daybreak.</p>

<p>“Now, forget about the lynx and don’t be so cast
down,” were the first words that Winkie said on
the following morning. “Don’t hold any ill-will
towards him. He was only thinking what a fine
meal you would make. All animals are looking out
for themselves.”</p>

<p>A turn in the long path brought them into Deertown.
A number of red deer were lying together
upon the grassy turf. They had slept well, for the
branches of the trees had formed a thick canopy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
over their heads. A stag with a reddish-brown coat
and big branching antlers was guarding them.
Several pretty fawns with brown eyes and white
coats were playing hide-and-seek in the bushes.
Although deer are quick to hear the footsteps of
larger animals, they paid no heed to the little
newcomers.</p>

<div id="Ref_164" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_164.jpg" width="600" height="569" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">“ISN’T THE STAG A NOBLE-LOOKING CREATURE?”</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t the stag noble-looking!” cried Tiny.
“What a big creature he is!”</p>

<p>“He is very proud,” said Winkie, less admiringly.
“He is also selfish, for he becomes angry if
any other stag comes inside his family circle.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it fortunate that we don’t have to wear
antlers?” laughed Tiny. “How funny you would
look, Winkie, with horns or antlers!”</p>

<p>“It is said that one can tell the age of a stag by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
looking at his antlers,” replied Winkie, with the
sprightliness that Tiny enjoyed. “Perhaps Mother
Goose is thankful, too, that she doesn’t have them.”</p>

<p>Not far beyond Deertown, the two associates
separated. Tiny was to go directly north, while
Winkie was to pass through several winding paths
to Weasel Bog.</p>

<p>“Goodby, Tiny. Carry your prize safely home,
and tell your mother that you well deserved it,”
said Winkie. “Some day I will bring my family to
see you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you wouldn’t be very welcome in
Squirreltown,” said Tiny. “However, I will meet
you alone at any time you suggest. I will fetch
you something good to eat.”</p>

<p>“Squirrels are all right in their bad opinions of
weasels,” said Winkie, regretfully. “I never
thought how scandalous my family would act, if I
took them to Squirreltown. I do not wish to visit
your village, but I will meet you at any place you
may suggest. I want to see you only. Let me hear
from you often.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Tiny, cheerily.</p>

<p>With another farewell he turned north and ran
as fast as he could. Two or three times he stopped
to eat some delicious acorns and other food he
found by the wayside, for Nature has bountifully
provided for the squirrel race.</p>

<p>He might have reached home without any more
dreadful encounters, had it not been for his
curiosity. While resting on the lower branch of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
beech tree, he saw an animal with soft, silky fur,
fast asleep on the bough above his head. He did
not know that the pretty, innocent-looking creature
was a wild cat, one of the most terrible beasts of
the wood. The thoughtless squirrel stole noiselessly
to the side of the sleeping animal and made a shrill,
screeching noise.</p>

<div id="Ref_166" class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_166.jpg" width="600" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">HE RAN WITH ALL HIS MIGHT ALONG THE PATH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wild cat awoke. Instantly it changed to a
ferocious monster, with ruffled fur and eyes that
seemed to shoot forth flames. With a snarl of rage,
it dashed at its disturber. Tiny, whose heart beat
wildly, dashed down the tree. Instead of seeking
refuge in some knothole, he ran with all his might
along the path. He expected to be killed at any
moment. Horror made him run all the faster, for
he knew that the wild cat was the most dreadful
animal he could possibly arouse.</p>

<p>Over fallen twigs and branches the frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
squirrel leapt, little thinking of other dangers
that might befall him. At last his strength began
to fail. He knew that he could hold out but a few
minutes longer. Torn by brush and briers, he
ascended an oak tree. A little door stood ajar. He
rushed through the tiny opening and fell prostrate.</p>

<p>When he regained his senses, a little gray animal
with liquid dark eyes was bending over him.</p>

<p>“Bushy Graysquirrel!” he cried in delight.</p>

<p>“I am very glad to receive you in my new home,”
was Bushy’s welcome greeting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>“I am so glad to see you!” exclaimed Tiny. “I
was running away from a wild cat, and met you
by accident.”</p>

<p>“I saw you running,” answered Bushy. “However,
I did not see a wild cat. Squirrels run faster
than wild cats, so I suppose he gave up the chase.”</p>

<p>“I am not a coward,” declared the red squirrel,
somewhat embarrassed, “but I think it is best to
run when a wild cat comes into one’s life.”</p>

<p>“In this forest are few wild cats,” asserted
Bushy. “They seldom disturb us, unless they are
provoked.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” asked Tiny, when
he had fully recovered from his shock.</p>

<p>“I live here in the country now,” was the reply.
“Perhaps you do not know that I have a mate. He
is out getting acorns for our luncheon. Of acorns
there is a great plenty in this part of the woods.
They cover the ground.”</p>

<p>“Has Squirreltown changed much?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“You would hardly know the place,” answered
the gray squirrel. “All our playmates have grown
up. Peggy and her mate live in the city, and Polly
Blacksquirrel and her mate own the big beech by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the brook. Dr. Flyingsquirrel has retired from
business on account of his great age. He must be
nearly five years old. Your mother, however, is
well and happy. Many citizens has Squirreltown.
Not one in a hundred leaves it for the country.
I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do you ever visit there?” interrupted Tiny.</p>

<p>“Neither of us has been back for some time,”
said Bushy. “We will go over to-night to attend
the celebration.”</p>

<p>“What celebration?”</p>

<p>“One which is to be given upon your return
home,” laughed Bushy.</p>

<p>Tiny then remembered that Mr. Owl had promised
the winner of the prize a still greater reward.
He felt very grateful and happy, but did not think
it polite to question Bushy any further.</p>

<p>After a short visit with his old friend, Tiny bade
her goodby, and resumed his journey. He hurried
along almost as fast as he did when he thought the
wild cat was after him, for he was anxious to see
his dear old home once more, and to receive his
mother’s welcome greeting.</p>

<p>While he was drinking at a small stream, he
heard a shrill cry. Before he could turn round, he
was pushed off his feet. Over and over he rolled,
until he almost fell into the water.</p>

<p>“Tiny, Tiny, I am so glad to see you!” cried a
well known voice.</p>

<p>“Chatty Chipmunk!” exclaimed Tiny, equally
delighted; for there was his earliest playmate dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
about like a wild creature. “Never before
have I received such an unexpected greeting.”</p>

<p>“I learned that you would be home to-day, and
have come to meet you,” continued Chatty. “Near
the city wait a number of your old friends. I
couldn’t stand still, so here I am.”</p>

<p>“Are you still fond of playing?” asked Tiny,
somewhat amused at his gay friend.</p>

<p>“Yes. I don’t suppose that I ever shall take life
seriously,” was the laughing reply. “Nature never
intended that I should work or study. However, I
have a thrifty mate, and she makes a very comfortable
living for me. Every one of those animals at
Squirreltown avoids me, but I do not care.”</p>

<p>“If I were mayor of Squirreltown, I would make
you work or let you starve,” said Tiny, severely.</p>

<p>“Your education has not improved your appearance,”
said Chatty, quickly changing the subject.
“You look old and all mussed up.”</p>

<p>“Animals who spend all their time in study are
apt to become careless of their personal appearance,”
explained Tiny. “You forget, however,
that I have had a long journey, and that animals of
good taste do not try to look too sleek when they
travel. They do not wish to attract attention.”</p>

<p>“Of what use are books and study?” inquired
Chatty.</p>

<p>“They are of no use to such as you,” replied the
squirrel impatiently.</p>

<p>“And what are you doing with that old goose
quill strapped to your back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the prize I won for good scholarship,”
said Tiny, rather disdainfully.</p>

<p>“How funny!” cried the chipmunk, laughing
until his sides ached. “How could an animal spend
so much time studying, just to win a goose quill?”</p>

<p>“You and I do not see things alike, Chatty,” said
Tiny, with an air of superiority. “It is not possible
for an uneducated animal like you to feel the
noble sentiment that makes this goose quill dear to
me.”</p>

<p>“You are as queer as some human beings,” declared
Chatty. “I have heard of a silly man that
studied for many years to win an old piece of
sheepskin.”</p>

<p>Tiny wisely forbore further argument. After a
few minutes’ rest was taken, he arose, and together
they hastened to Squirreltown.</p>

<p>When the grand old trees of the city appeared to
view, Tiny shouted for joy. There is nothing in
life so dear as home and its associations, and the
country in which one lives, and the individuals
with whom one associates.</p>

<p>Although sentinels had been stationed at the entrances
of the highways to meet Tiny, he stole up a
back street; for he wished to see his mother first of
all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Redsquirrel was preparing the last meal of
the day. Although somewhat older in appearance
than when he left her, she seemed as beautiful as
ever to Tiny.</p>

<p>“Mother!” he cried, as he rushed into the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>With shrieks of joy, the good creature bounded
over the table and to and fro until she was exhausted.</p>

<p>“Welcome! welcome home!” she cried, her little
heart fairly bursting with motherly love and joy.</p>

<p>They chatted until dusk began to steal over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Squirreltown. At last they were interrupted by
Chatty Chipmunk.</p>

<p>“You are under arrest, Tiny,” he said, gravely.
“I am bidden by the mayor to take you to the park
which faces the city hall.”</p>

<p>Tiny and his mother good-naturedly followed
Chatty, thinking that perhaps he was, as of old,
playing some joke upon them.</p>

<p>“Be merciful to me, Tiny,” pleaded Chatty, on
their way to the park. “Remember that I am your
oldest friend. I promise you that I will lead a useful
life in the future. My greatest regret now is
that I trifled all my time away when I was young.”</p>

<p>Tiny did not reply. They had entered the
green park, facing which was a decayed log with
many doors and windows. It was used as a city
hall.</p>

<div id="Ref_172" class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">WHAT WAS TINY’S SURPRISE TO FIND ALL THE CITIZENS OF SQUIRRELTOWN
GATHERED THERE TO MEET HIM!</p></div>
</div>

<p>What was Tiny’s surprise to find all the citizens
of Squirreltown gathered there to meet him. There
were the aged mayor at the door of the city hall, the
militia, the policemen, and all the aldermen and
other dignitaries of the city. Every one was dignified
and silent. Tiny and his mother were led by
two policemen to the little balcony over the entrance
to the building. They were unable to speak,
from surprise and wonderment.</p>

<p>“Hoot! hoot! hoot!” rang out from a bough over
their heads. This cry was evidently another signal
to enforce perfect order. Tiny gazed up timidly,
and saw the yellow eyes of the owl prophet staring
down upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>“Citizens of Squirreltown,” cried Mr. Owl, “I,
the wisest of all living creatures, take pleasure in
presenting to you, Mr. Tiny Redsquirrel, the new
mayor of Squirreltown!”</p>

<p>Flapping his wings in approbation, he flew away,
never to return again.</p>

<p>Then wild cheers rent the air. Never since that
time has Squirreltown been so riotous. Before
Tiny could realize his exalted position, he was surrounded
by his old friends. There were Dr. Flyingsquirrel
and his family, Chatty Chipmunk and
his mate, Peggy and Bushy Graysquirrel, Polly
Blacksquirrel, and many others, cheering and wishing
him success and happiness.</p>

<p>Hundreds of lightning bugs circled above their
heads, throwing out green and orange-colored rays.
Billy Foxsquirrel and his band whistled gay airs;
a frog orchestra close by joined them; and a chorus
of friendly mosquitoes, and other insects, completed
the grand refrain. Until far into the night, laughter
and rejoicing reigned triumphant. What Tiny
did for Squirreltown in after years is more than
any boy or girl could imagine.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
